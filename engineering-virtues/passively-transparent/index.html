<p>Nobody should have to <em>ask</em> what you&rsquo;re working on. You should leave an obvious, loud trail. Encourage this pattern in others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that is important to me as an engineer that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen put in writing is something I have distilled into the term <em>passively transparent</em>.</p>
<p>It should be obvious to the people in leadership what is motivating you to work and what you are working on (transparency), and it should not require an on-demand effort on your part to communicate this to them (passive access).</p>
<p>You should be transparent for the reason that you are setting a baseline of what you are expecting to share with your manager: if they feel like you aren&rsquo;t giving good status it gives them tacit permission to ask <em>too many questions</em> or <em>questions that are inappropriately deep</em>. Calibrate the level of communication by setting it yourself: keep your management at an arm&rsquo;s length in how they use your time and attention. &ldquo;I refer you to this query on GitHub, which you may access at any time&rdquo; when someone asks about your deliverables should be a response you aspire for and your leadership accepts.</p>
<p>You should be passively available for the reason that you are setting a baseline of when and how you are making yourself available to your manager: you, as my lead, should not have to wait for things to escalate to me openly broadcasting a crisis state before reaching out. You should also be able to do a pulse check without requiring my intervention. My time is precious, and I should not be forced to choose <em>which</em> time I give to you via a scheduled 1:1 if I can choose to give you <em>the time that matters, when I have it</em> to share progress.</p>
<p>A lot of the agile software movement and its offshoots attempt to codify and formalize processes of behavior that boil down to expressing these values:</p>
<h1 id="keep-track-of-what-you-are-working-on">Keep Track Of What You Are Working On</h1>
<p>If a manager or peer wants to see what you are working on, they shouldn&rsquo;t have to ask for a status update: they should be able to figure it out on their own at any time on demand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a draft PR the <em>second</em> you begin coding, push to it regularly. Hourly, during a standard working day, if you can.</li>
<li>Broadcast your current status on your issue tracking site: it is more work in the short run, but give you warm fuzzies (line go down on burndown) and lets you give high-value opportunities to course correct before going too far.
<ul>
<li>Keep tickets at a 1-3 working day granularity and</li>
<li>Move them along the started -&gt; in progress -&gt; finished pipeline quickly to telegraph to your management that you are working
<ol>
<li>Independently</li>
<li>On the right things</li>
<li>At a reasonable pace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="share-what-you-are-doing-with-others">Share What You Are Doing With Others</h1>
<ul>
<li>Set permissions by default to <em>commenter</em> or <em>editor</em> on every document and web site you start.</li>
<li>Assume if someone is curious enough to want to know something that they are a stakeholder, whether they like it or not. Let them know. Pull them in.</li>
<li>Share everything: use public Slack channels. Private channels and DMs are for shit talking and performance reviews, not for day-to-day work.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="dont-let-_when_-something-happens-influence-_how_-and-_why_-it-happens-too-much">Don&rsquo;t Let <em>When</em> Something Happens Influence <em>How</em> And <em>Why</em> It Happens Too Much</h1>
<p>This is something that has always mattered to me, doubly so with the forced async-by-default working world inflicted on us by the pandemic years and working with multi-time-zone teams.</p>
<p>Make decisions (choose one end, these are opposite ends of a continuum):</p>
<ul>
<li>As quickly as possible with minimal consensus but easy to change course on</li>
<li>As late as possible with as long as reasonable to get input on</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="encourage-this-behavior-in-others">Encourage This Behavior In Others</h1>
<p>One way to promote this way of working is to practice it yourself: when working in a team, engage with your peers with the assumption that they are working in a passively transparent manner themselves.</p>
<p>Quick, no-expectations messages on Slack can do wonders in a non-forceful way by gently framing your working style as conventional:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I was reading your draft PR, looks good&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is there a Jira queue I&rsquo;m not watching where you&rsquo;re doing daily updates?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
