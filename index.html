 some of y’all are out here just knowing things without sharing what you know on a blog post—why
 I do not owe you a singular god damned thing, period, and it is not my job to provide internet strangers with summaries of my hard-earned lessons. Especially if idiots will comment about it on Hacker News or whatever.
Update: Lol I got got blocked on Twitter for having a strong contrary opinion

		There is a convenient but untrue fiction about Python that the language specification is somehow cleanroom and CPython is actually &ldquo;just an implementation.&rdquo;
This has always been false, and harmful at best.
Look at __dict__. Near every Python object has a dictionary that fuels and consumes it. All your dotted getters are mere passthroughs for dot __getitem__ers.
Another fun thing is the leaking of implementation details in Bad Ways. Here&rsquo;s something you can do but should not do, lest I find out where you live and poop in your mailbox:

       Thinking Back, It Was All So Simple Now we have the system up and running, let&rsquo;s talk random obstacles and next steps. This sis something of an epilogue to the saga, as it&rsquo;s a lit of small things that accrued while working on the project
Networks are slow and the dual tier service thing is bad, actually I initially chose to run a service on the Nginx server that then called to a service running on the RPi.

		Hardware The RPi The Raspberry Pi is a (I think) Pi 3 with Wifi I found in the garage with a cheap clear acrylic case. It might have been a RetroPie rig in a prior life? Or one I was &ldquo;gonna get around to&rdquo; doing something with and finally did?
Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.
The Printer The printer is a hefty boi, a Zebra something or other.

 Display information Perform access control (don&rsquo;t let strangers on the internet print out jobs) Forward appropriate calls to the backend  I&rsquo;m using Go&rsquo;s base templates for dynamic content, the Echo framework for the webapp endpoints, and plain old bare bones modern javascripto for the scripting stuff with no polyfills, no build environments, no minifiers, and boy does it feel good.

		Introduction In my spare time on weekends in between errands and mornings before everyone wakes up, I&rsquo;ve been working on a little project I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with: ZPL-O-Rama.
The Problem A large part of my employer&rsquo;s line of business is creating shipping labels, and a large number of those aren&rsquo;t simply printed images, but printed on very high volume, heavy duty, industrial grade printers using a proprietary language called ZPL.

At around the same time I hit my iPod Classic&rsquo;s 160GB limit. I&rsquo;m not yet ready to hack it up to have bigger storage: I plan to keep it in working &ldquo;original&rdquo; condition as it may find a better home in the future with some collector who is better at soldering than I.

		So it&rsquo;s 2021 and about the entirety of my job is integrating third party systems with internal ones, which then reach out to other third-party services.
A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&rsquo;s sake.

		This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.
 A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk.

I&rsquo;ve tried to use full tiling managers before but I&rsquo;ve found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.

Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.

		As the parent of an almost three year old, I don&rsquo;t get much time to myself, and I&rsquo;ve given up on video games that don&rsquo;t have playtimes under 15 minutes (that discounts anything with load times or cutscenes). In my spare time I have to find other things to do that are low impact and can be cut into small amounts of time.
I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.

Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.

		I&rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.
