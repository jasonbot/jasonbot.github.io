		I&rsquo;m not going into specs or specific details on this device. I was on an iPhone XS, which has slowly been degrading over time. Battery was slowly dying, replaced it at the Apple Store, the ribbon cable for the display was not adequately clipped back into place. It was easier to just order a new phone than to take the bus up to Emeryville again in the middle of the day for an appointment.

		One thing I love about Python&rsquo;s practical approach to type annotations and enforcement is that it&rsquo;s gradual: you can rapidly code a large ball of mud and get it working, then refine it to make it safer with typing later on.
Chalk this up as another good idea (possibly by accident) for Python: you can do the same with async.
At work, someone lamented that threads aren&rsquo;t quite safe but they needed to do multiple http requests in parallel.

		The Python 3.10 release includes the new match statement, which superficially looks like the case/switch statements in other languages but semantically is closer to pattern matching in Haskell or Rust.
Like the walrus operator*, I struggled to find a use case for this and it seemed like a feature that was added just because the language is 30+ years old and all the good new functionality is taken.
However, I found a pretty good case for it that used to be a lot more work: duck-typey arguments that make default case rules easy but enable more complex functionality as needed.

Async programming in modern &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; languages is shrouded in magic, abstractions, and years of atrocious decisions (looking at you, Javascript/Python). Most tutorials start out with &ldquo;just mark your function async and await it and use these magic incantations and you&rsquo;re good to go!

This has always been false, and harmful at best.
Look at __dict__. Near every Python object has a dictionary that fuels and consumes it. All your dotted getters are mere passthroughs for dot __getitem__ers.
Another fun thing is the leaking of implementation details in Bad Ways. Here&rsquo;s something you can do but should not do, lest I find out where you live and poop in your mailbox:

Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.

The Problem A large part of my employer&rsquo;s line of business is creating shipping labels, and a large number of those aren&rsquo;t simply printed images, but printed on very high volume, heavy duty, industrial grade printers using a proprietary language called ZPL.

A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&rsquo;s sake.

		This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.
A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk.

I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.

		So I bought that dang Chromebook over three years ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.

		February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In restrospect it&rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.

		I&rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.

		I gave a short (~10) minute talk on preparing to move to microservices at the Python meetup in San Francisco.
The main points:
We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice

Turning a Piece of Shit Chromebook into a Good Enough Development Machine Because You&rsquo;re Unemployed and Feel Like An Ass Trying to Justify Spending $2000 on a God Damned Macbook so You Wound Up Buying a Chromebook Instead Anyway, I&rsquo;m unemployed because of reasons and figured there were better things to do with the credit limit on my credit card than spend $2000 on a Macbook, so I bought one of the highest rated Chromebooks at my &ldquo;willing to pay this much&rdquo; price point: the Chromebook C100P.

Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco.

@bottle.route(&#39;/&#39;) def index(): bottle.response.content_type = &#39;text/plain&#39; return (&#34;=== API REFERENCE ===\n&#34; + &#34;\n&#34;.join(x[&#39;rule&#39;] for x in bottle.app().routes))

		For as much shit as I like to talk about C++, I sure can get a lot done quite efficiently in it.
I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the with statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.

		I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.
I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new.
