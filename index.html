		I&rsquo;m not participating in his year&rsquo;s Advent of Code. Every year I try and get stymied by day 14 of so because of practical considerations.
It Emphasizes Fast Solutions over Good Ones The entire gamification of the problems is about solving them as quickly as possible. Not about maintainable solutions, not rewarding cleverness, the scoreboard is entirely fueled by finishing quickly.
A professional software engineer does not hammer out code as quickly as possible.

		In my previous post I wanted to run a keepalive green thread on the wide while doing work to let the coordination framework (in this case just a plain old Postgres database) which workers were around and still processing work.
Now, I have a long-running block of synchronous code.
Herein lies the problem: synchronous code does not play nicely in the async event loop. It doesn&rsquo;t take breaks to &ldquo;breathe.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t yield control to a scheduler.

		At work I&rsquo;m currently working on a fairly large system in which we have a pool of greedy workers, of unknown size, which can opt it at any time to the flow of work.
A job is considered abandoned if it is marked as IN_PROGRESS but the worker who has claimed it hasn&rsquo;t phoned home in sone amount of time.
The project is async, which makes things bot more and less interesting.

The thing is: Windows is annoying. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run a third-party uninstall tool to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.

The Anbernic RG35XX presented itself as an alternative, and it was actually possible to buy one.
I got one for about $60 on Amazon and was immediately in love. It had a decent built in game library, decent battery life, and was the perfect size. Not too big, not to small.

So here&rsquo;s what I added to my settings.json to get the best of both worlds (light theme turned on):

		I bought a Steam Deck. I was on a waiting list that said I would get it until this year (2023), but it arrived in October 2022.
This thing is so versatile thanks to its Desktop Mode. For games like the boomer shooters I so love, I can dock the Deck and play with a mouse and keyboard and nicer monitor. I can install Flatpaks.
The gaming experience is bar none the best.

		I kickstarted the AOKZOE A1 when I was utterly convince that I would never get a Steam Deck.
Joke&rsquo;s on me; the Deck arrived before the A1.
I primarily use this system as my sole Win11 machine, so it does a lot of light desktop work. It is also my &ldquo;travel&rdquo; laptop; when I&rsquo;m travelling I take this and not my Steam Deck. Everything is tunable, but it draws way more power than a Deck and generally lasts about the same amount of time even with the larger battery.

		One thing I love about Python&rsquo;s practical approach to type annotations and enforcement is that it&rsquo;s gradual: you can rapidly code a large ball of mud and get it working, then refine it to make it safer with typing later on.
Chalk this up as another good idea (possibly by accident) for Python: you can do the same with async.
At work, someone lamented that threads aren&rsquo;t quite safe but they needed to do multiple http requests in parallel.

		The Python 3.10 release includes the new match statement, which superficially looks like the case/switch statements in other languages but semantically is closer to pattern matching in Haskell or Rust.
Like the walrus operator*, I struggled to find a use case for this and it seemed like a feature that was added just because the language is 30+ years old and all the good new functionality is taken.
However, I found a pretty good case for it that used to be a lot more work: duck-typey arguments that make default case rules easy but enable more complex functionality as needed.

 Async programming in modern &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; languages is shrouded in magic, abstractions, and years of atrocious decisions (looking at you, Javascript/Python). Most tutorials start out with &ldquo;just mark your function async and await it and use these magic incantations and you&rsquo;re good to go!

		Running the software Frontend server The frontend has three responsibilities:
 Display information Perform access control (don&rsquo;t let strangers on the internet print out jobs) Forward appropriate calls to the backend  I&rsquo;m using Go&rsquo;s base templates for dynamic content, the Echo framework for the webapp endpoints, and plain old bare bones modern javascripto for the scripting stuff with no polyfills, no build environments, no minifiers, and boy does it feel good.

		Problem Space To automate the process of printing and reporting back a ZPL payload, we need:
 A way to get the ZPL from the user A way to send the ZPL to a printer A way to take a picture A way to send it back to the user  A way to get the ZPL from the user A web service makes sense here. We want an API or a frontend (or both) to send the ZPL along and check its printing status.

		Introduction In my spare time on weekends in between errands and mornings before everyone wakes up, I&rsquo;ve been working on a little project I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with: ZPL-O-Rama.
The Problem A large part of my employer&rsquo;s line of business is creating shipping labels, and a large number of those aren&rsquo;t simply printed images, but printed on very high volume, heavy duty, industrial grade printers using a proprietary language called ZPL.

		Introduction A while ago I was bored with the Mechanical Keyboard rabbit hole and started looking into other, equally strange rabbit holes to dive into. At around the same time I hit my iPod Classic&rsquo;s 160GB limit. I&rsquo;m not yet ready to hack it up to have bigger storage: I plan to keep it in working &ldquo;original&rdquo; condition as it may find a better home in the future with some collector who is better at soldering than I.

		So it&rsquo;s 2021 and about the entirety of my job is integrating third party systems with internal ones, which then reach out to other third-party services.
A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&rsquo;s sake.

		This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.
 A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk.

		I&rsquo;ve been using the Rectangle window manager for mac for the last couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s been the most helpful thing since Mission Control (and setting up a hot corner to activate it).
I&rsquo;ve tried to use full tiling managers before but I&rsquo;ve found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.

		I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.
Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.

		As the parent of an almost three year old, I don&rsquo;t get much time to myself, and I&rsquo;ve given up on video games that don&rsquo;t have playtimes under 15 minutes (that discounts anything with load times or cutscenes). In my spare time I have to find other things to do that are low impact and can be cut into small amounts of time.
I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.

Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.

		February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In retrospect it&rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.

		I&rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.

 We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice

I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new.
