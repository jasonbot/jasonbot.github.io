			We’re a couple of years into the LLM hype cycle and the volume at this point is deafening. I use LLMs, and I find them interesting, and they have played a major part of my professional life for the past two and a half years.
That said, I can’t declare them an unqualified success or a miracle cure for anything. I approach them with a combination of skepticism and grief. I understand they are here to stay and I will do my best to use them effectively in the use cases where they are indeed effective.

			Problem Space At my new job, my new team engages in a team activity: every other week we get together for 30 minutes to play a game together online. We’re mixed hybrid, meaning about half of us work in office and half of us are grandfathered/exceptioned in to working remotely. this means we can’t play a board/card game in person, but has to be procurable over the internet in a Zoom call.

			I’m an enthusiast of playing around with different window management schemes. I like the idea of a tiling window manager, but I’m not smart enough to ever get really productive in something like i3 or sway.
for the past few years I’ve been using Rectangle on MacOS as something of a band-aid
I’ve been using the Tiling WM Extension ion Gnome for a while, and I’ve been pretty happy with it.

			I got my first job as a software engineer in 2000, so in 2024 I’m pushing a quarter century of being a developer. This is one of the topics I have begun to hold near and dear to my heart.
Software engineering is a team sport. If you’re not setting new players up for success, you’re not being the best teammate you could be. Supporting others is just as important as getting your needs met.

			A common antipattern I’ve been both perpetrator of and victim to is what I describe as Framework Syndrome. This is the act of writing software that does not solve the inherent problem at hand, but provides a poorly designed scaffold in which one is expected to eventually “fill in the blanks.” That is, in the absence of the ability or desire to make the code do what it needs to do, kick the can down the road while at the same time writing mountains of not particularly useful code that will never be fully excised from the codebase.

			In my previous post I wanted to run a keepalive green thread on the wide while doing work to let the coordination framework (in this case just a plain old Postgres database) which workers were around and still processing work.
Now, I have a long-running block of synchronous code.
Herein lies the problem: synchronous code does not play nicely in the async event loop. It doesn’t take breaks to “breathe.” It doesn’t yield control to a scheduler.

A job is considered abandoned if it is marked as IN_PROGRESS but the worker who has claimed it hasn’t phoned home in sone amount of time.
The project is async, which makes things bot more and less interesting.

			I have a Gaming PC I bought from Costco when my wife told me “I should maybe get back into my old hobbies” in the summer of 2020. It came with Win10, which is fine and it’s probably good to have at least one Windows machine in the house at any given time.
The thing is: Windows is annoying. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run a third-party uninstall tool to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren’t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.
