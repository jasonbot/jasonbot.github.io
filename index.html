			I&rsquo;ve been using the Tailwind CSS Framework for about two and a half years (as of July 2025) for my personal projects, and I used it professionally in my time at unstructured as well. In all, I think it&rsquo;s a good thing. However, I don&rsquo;t find myself thinking I&rsquo;d use it for new projects at this point: I believe I have outgrown it. Here is a short story.
Tailwind as Style Guide Tailwind has a set of that encourages a specific styling worldview that gets you a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; looking UI which doesn&rsquo;t feel offensive versus any other site on the internet. The pre-baked color choices and reasonable framing around layout options like columns give you a framework (ha!) within which to work and make a decent site. It&rsquo;s less greenfield than a blank page and an open documentation tab.

			 Top Matter: GitHub for the library, doc for the library.
It&rsquo;s been six months since I&rsquo;ve done this, but I&rsquo;m finally writing about it!
Go recently added proper iterator support to the language, which is something of an improvement over the prior pattern of spinning up a goroutine and communicating via a channel in a range to get a stream of values.
One of the tools in my toolbox that I use in coding interviews and some light data processing work is Python&rsquo;s itertools. The nice thing about this library is it gives you a good set of conceptual building blocks to use as a frame around a problem and a fairly clean way to use them. Once you&rsquo;re familiar with, say, combinations and permutations you can take a harder problem and decompose it into those recognizable parts and then have a stdlib function that&rsquo;s already bug free and readily available.

			I&rsquo;m trying out the Harper tool in VS Code.
I&rsquo;ve been aware of its existence for about 6 months and didn&rsquo;t think much of it, just another rehash of existing tools.
But I&rsquo;ve come around to the idea that rewriting old tools isn&rsquo;t a horrible notion: the people who crafted them were no smarter or dumber than ourselves, they were just before us. Rewriting the same thing is a lot like repaving an old road: core infrastructure, but with new materials maybe we can do it better. If anything, we should share in some of the fun the people who came before us got to have.

			A common pattern I have come to recognize everywhere as an anti-pattern:
Person starts a dialogue establishing a problem, upon which we all agree Person continues on down the same line of conversation, outlining a solution Person comes to a conclusion which is a call to action I see this a lot because step 1 seems to short-circuit the thinking behind the rest of the logic. You got a narrative going that you feel compelled to continue to listen to, and assume it&rsquo;s only going to stay sane.

			We&rsquo;re a couple of years into the LLM hype cycle and the volume at this point is deafening. I use LLMs, and I find them interesting, and they have played a major part of my professional life for the past two and a half years.
That said, I can&rsquo;t declare them an unqualified success or a miracle cure for anything. I approach them with a combination of skepticism and grief. I understand they are here to stay and I will do my best to use them effectively in the use cases where they are indeed effective. However, I think it is both foolish and irresponsible to myself/my employers/my friends/my peers/society in general to see them solely in a positive light and I think we need to consider critically how we want to approach them.

			I&rsquo;m an enthusiast of playing around with different window management schemes. I like the idea of a tiling window manager, but I&rsquo;m not smart enough to ever get really productive in something like i3 or sway.
for the past few years I&rsquo;ve been using Rectangle on MacOS as something of a band-aid
I&rsquo;ve been using the Tiling WM Extension ion Gnome for a while, and I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with it. It does a good job of emulating one of the better features on Win11, a progressive way to arrange windows in an ordered way.

Software engineering is a team sport. If you&rsquo;re not setting new players up for success, you&rsquo;re not being the best teammate you could be. Supporting others is just as important as getting your needs met.

			A common antipattern I&rsquo;ve been both perpetrator of and victim to is what I describe as Framework Syndrome. This is the act of writing software that does not solve the inherent problem at hand, but provides a poorly designed scaffold in which one is expected to eventually &ldquo;fill in the blanks.&rdquo; That is, in the absence of the ability or desire to make the code do what it needs to do, kick the can down the road while at the same time writing mountains of not particularly useful code that will never be fully excised from the codebase.

I&rsquo;m not participating in his year&rsquo;s Advent of Code. Every year I try and get stymied by day 14 of so because of practical considerations.

			In my previous post I wanted to run a keepalive green thread on the wide while doing work to let the coordination framework (in this case just a plain old Postgres database) which workers were around and still processing work.
Now, I have a long-running block of synchronous code.
Herein lies the problem: synchronous code does not play nicely in the async event loop. It doesn&rsquo;t take breaks to &ldquo;breathe.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t yield control to a scheduler. It just runs and runs. This can be fine in some cases where e.g. network activity stops or becomes infrequent while work is done but in this case we want the secondary green thread to continue to phone back home while the process runs to let it know that, hey, this process is still alive and doing work but the work it&rsquo;s currently doing is taking a while.

The thing is: Windows is annoying. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run a third-party uninstall tool to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.

I got one for about $60 on Amazon and was immediately in love. It had a decent built in game library, decent battery life, and was the perfect size. Not too big, not to small. Fits in a pants pocket or a little random orner of a carrying bag no problem.

This thing is so versatile thanks to its Desktop Mode. For games like the boomer shooters I so love, I can dock the Deck and play with a mouse and keyboard and nicer monitor. I can install Flatpaks.
The gaming experience is bar none the best. Steam OS is an accomplishment. It has none of the fiddly bits around power management etc that a standard Linux machine does. It&rsquo;s a usable, console-quality experience.

			I&rsquo;m not going into specs or specific details on this device. I was on an iPhone XS, which has slowly been degrading over time. Battery was slowly dying, replaced it at the Apple Store, the ribbon cable for the display was not adequately clipped back into place. It was easier to just order a new phone than to take the bus up to Emeryville again in the middle of the day for an appointment.

			One thing I love about Python&rsquo;s practical approach to type annotations and enforcement is that it&rsquo;s gradual: you can rapidly code a large ball of mud and get it working, then refine it to make it safer with typing later on.
Chalk this up as another good idea (possibly by accident) for Python: you can do the same with async.
At work, someone lamented that threads aren&rsquo;t quite safe but they needed to do multiple http requests in parallel.

			The Python 3.10 release includes the new match statement, which superficially looks like the case/switch statements in other languages but semantically is closer to pattern matching in Haskell or Rust.
Like the walrus operator*, I struggled to find a use case for this and it seemed like a feature that was added just because the language is 30+ years old and all the good new functionality is taken.
However, I found a pretty good case for it that used to be a lot more work: duck-typey arguments that make default case rules easy but enable more complex functionality as needed.

Async programming in modern &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; languages is shrouded in magic, abstractions, and years of atrocious decisions (looking at you, Javascript/Python). Most tutorials start out with &ldquo;just mark your function async and await it and use these magic incantations and you&rsquo;re good to go!&rdquo; without explaining the underlying concepts that were built up

			There is a convenient but untrue fiction about Python that the language specification is somehow cleanroom and CPython is actually &ldquo;just an implementation.&rdquo;
This has always been false, and harmful at best.
Look at __dict__. Near every Python object has a dictionary that fuels and consumes it. All your dotted getters are mere passthroughs for dot __getitem__ers.
Another fun thing is the leaking of implementation details in Bad Ways. Here&rsquo;s something you can do but should not do, lest I find out where you live and poop in your mailbox:

Thinking Back, It Was All So Simple Now we have the system up and running, let&rsquo;s talk random obstacles and next steps. This is something of an epilogue to the saga, as it&rsquo;s a list of small things that accrued while working on the project.
Networks are slow and the dual tier service thing is bad, actually I initially chose to run a service on the Nginx server that then called to a service running on the RPi. Since there were Very Large PNGs being shuttled around a LOT, this was inefficient from a speed perspective because of the bandwidth consumed over my shitty cable connection.

Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.
The Printer The printer is a hefty boi, a Zebra something or other. It belongs to work. It has an ethernet port, a lot of lights, an air of proprietary grandeur, and a hunger for paper and electricity.

			So it&rsquo;s 2021 and about the entirety of my job is integrating third party systems with internal ones, which then reach out to other third-party services.
A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&rsquo;s sake.

			 This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.
A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk. It&rsquo;s faster, safer, and less ugly.

			I&rsquo;ve been using the Rectangle window manager for mac for the last couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s been the most helpful thing since Mission Control (and setting up a hot corner to activate it).
I&rsquo;ve tried to use full tiling managers before but I&rsquo;ve found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.

			I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.
Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.

			As the parent of an almost three year old, I don&rsquo;t get much time to myself, and I&rsquo;ve given up on video games that don&rsquo;t have playtimes under 15 minutes (that discounts anything with load times or cutscenes). In my spare time I have to find other things to do that are low impact and can be cut into small amounts of time.
I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices. I&rsquo;ve developed a newly renewed interest in hardware/software and gone fully into writing stuff like Lua and Rust on small ARM devices like RPis and Pine64s.

			So I bought that dang Chromebook over three years ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.

			February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In retrospect it&rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.

			I&rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime. Amazon will randomly flip bits. Its hosted services will go down without warning and leave you helpless but to wait &ndash; you&rsquo;re down until Amazon Hosted Whatever Thing decides to go back up (and the status page will lie about it being up).

			I gave a short (~10) minute talk on preparing to move to microservices at the Python meetup in San Francisco.
The main points:
We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice

Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco. I&rsquo;ve been here about three months now and this is a list of (some) of the things I like about my new job.

			For as much shit as I like to talk about C++, I sure can get a lot done quite efficiently in it.
I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the with statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.

			I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.
I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new. I remember KDE 2 was awesome, but I don’t remember much past that. A friend and coworker introduced me to Debian and I was amazed at how much more intuitive it was to use. It didn’t leave me out in the cold to fend for myself, but it automated enough of the low-levels of Linux that it made the rest seem approachable. And its default configuration was super lightweight and not memory hungry at all. I was sold.
