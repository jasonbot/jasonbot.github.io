<p>At <a href="https://www.academia.edu/">my new job</a>, my new team engages in a team activity: every other week we get together for 30 minutes to play a game together online. We&rsquo;re mixed hybrid, meaning about half of us work in office and half of us are grandfathered/exceptioned in to working remotely. this means we can&rsquo;t play a board/card game in person, but has to be procurable over the internet in a Zoom call.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As an exercise in self-improvement and understanding what the hell it is I actually do at work, I had promised myself (and, unfortunately, my manager) I&rsquo;d implement a RAG from conception to finish by Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 2024. It is now Independence Day weekend 2024. Missed the mark by a bit.</p>

		<p>A common antipattern I&rsquo;ve been both perpetrator of and victim to is what I describe as <em>Framework Syndrome</em>. This is the act of writing software that does not solve the inherent problem at hand, but provides a poorly designed scaffold in which one is expected to eventually &ldquo;fill in the blanks.&rdquo; That is, in the absence of the ability or desire to make the code do what it needs to do, kick the can down the road while at the same time writing mountains of not particularly useful code that will never be fully excised from the codebase.</p>

		<p>In <a href="/weblog/signs-of-life-in-async/">my previous post</a> I wanted to run a keepalive green thread on the wide while doing work to let the coordination framework (in this case just a plain old Postgres database) which workers were around and still processing work.</p>
<p>Now, I have a long-running block of synchronous code.</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem: synchronous code does not play nicely in the async event loop. It doesn&rsquo;t take breaks to &ldquo;breathe.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t yield control to a scheduler. It just runs and runs. This <em>can</em> be fine in some cases where e.g. network activity stops or becomes infrequent while work is done but in this case we want the secondary green thread to continue to phone back home while the process runs to let it know that, hey, this process is still alive and doing work but the work it&rsquo;s currently doing is taking a while.</p>

<p>The thing is: Windows is <em>annoying</em>.

<p>This thing is so versatile thanks to its Desktop Mode. For games like the boomer shooters I so love, I can dock the Deck and play with a mouse and keyboard and nicer monitor. I can install Flatpaks.</p>
<p>The gaming experience is bar none the best. Steam OS is an accomplishment. It has none of the fiddly bits around power management etc that a standard Linux machine does. It&rsquo;s a usable, console-quality experience.</p>

		<p>The Python 3.10 release includes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-match-statement">new <code>match</code> statement</a>, which superficially looks like the <code>case</code>/<code>switch</code> statements in other languages but semantically is closer to pattern matching in <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions">Haskell</a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#assignment-expressions">walrus operator</a>*, I struggled to find a use case for this and it seemed like a feature that was added just because the language is 30+ years old and all the <em>good</em> new functionality is taken.</p>
<p>However, I found a pretty good case for it that used to be a lot more work: duck-typey arguments that make default case rules easy but enable more complex functionality as needed.</p>

<p>Async programming in modern &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; languages is shrouded in magic, abstractions, and years of atrocious decisions (looking at you, Javascript/Python). Most tutorials start out with &ldquo;just mark your function <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> it and use these magic incantations and you&rsquo;re good to go!&rdquo; without explaining the underlying concepts that were built up</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is a (I think) Pi 3 with Wifi I found in the garage with a cheap clear acrylic case. It might have been a RetroPie rig in a prior life? Or one I was &ldquo;gonna get around to&rdquo; doing something with and finally did?</p>
<p>Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.</p>
<h2 id="the-printer">The Printer</h2>
<p>The printer is a hefty boi, a Zebra something or other. It belongs to work. It has an ethernet port, a lot of lights, an air of proprietary grandeur, and a hunger for paper and electricity.</p>

<p>This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.</p>

<p>A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html">tempfile module</a>.</p>
<p>You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#binary-i-o">BytesIO</a> class follows <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object">the exact same protocol</a>, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk. It&rsquo;s faster, safer, and less ugly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.

		<p>For as much shit as I like to talk about C++, I sure can get a lot done quite efficiently in it.</p>
<p>I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the <code>with</code> statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.</p>

		<p>I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.</p>
<p>I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new. I remember KDE 2 was awesome, but I don’t remember much past that. A friend and coworker introduced me to Debian and I was amazed at how much more intuitive it was to use. It didn’t leave me out in the cold to fend for myself, but it automated enough of the low-levels of Linux that it made the rest seem approachable. And its default configuration was super lightweight and not memory hungry at all. I was sold.</p>
