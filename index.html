		Introduction A while ago I was bored with the Mechanical Keyboard rabbit hole and started looking into other, equally strange rabbit holes to dive into. At the same time, I hit my iPod Classic&rsquo;s 160GB limit and I&rsquo;m not yet ready to hack it up to have bigger storage, but to keep it in working condition for posterity as it may find a better home in the future with some collector who is better at soldering than I.

		So it&rsquo;s 2021 and about the entirety of my job is integrating third party systems with internal ones, which then reach out to other third-party services.
A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&rsquo;s sake.

		This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&rsquo;s internal system, but it&rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&rsquo;ll share.
 A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &ldquo;file-like object&rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk.

		I&rsquo;ve been using the Rectangle window manager for mac for the last couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s been the most helpful thing since Mission Control (and setting up a hot corner to activate it).
I&rsquo;ve tried to use full tiling managers before but I&rsquo;ve found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.

		I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.
Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.

		As the parent of an almost three year old, I don&rsquo;t get much time to myself, and I&rsquo;ve given up on video games that don&rsquo;t have playtimes under 15 minutes (that discounts anything with load times or cutscenes). In my spare time I have to find other things to do that are low impact and can be cut into small amounts of time.
I&rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.

		So I bought that dang Chromebook over three years ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.

		February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In restrospect it&rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.

		I&rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.

		I gave a short (~10) minute talk on preparing to move to microservices at the Python meetup in San Francisco.
The main points:
 We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice

Turning a Piece of Shit Chromebook into a Good Enough Development Machine Because You&rsquo;re Unemployed and Feel Like An Ass Trying to Justify Spending $2000 on a God Damned Macbook so You Wound Up Buying a Chromebook Instead Anyway, I&rsquo;m unemployed because of reasons and figured there were better things to do with the credit limit on my credit card than spend $2000 on a Macbook, so I bought one of the highest rated Chromebooks at my &ldquo;willing to pay this much&rdquo; price point: the Chromebook C100P.

 Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco.

I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the with statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.

		I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.
I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new.
