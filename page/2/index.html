			Wanting a small, pocketable handheld for bus rides, etc., I saw the Miyoo Mini and attempted to purchase one. They are incredibly hard to acquire.
The Anbernic RG35XX presented itself as an alternative, and it was actually possible to buy one.
I got one for about $60 on Amazon and was immediately in love. It had a decent built in game library, decent battery life, and was the perfect size. Not too big, not to small.

			I’m a weirdo: on my IDEs I prefer a light theme, having used light themed IDEs since time immemorial (still miss using Visual Studio regularly). But I prefer white on black for my terminal emulators, as I have used that since time immemorial and a black on white terminal window doesn’t feel like a serious thing.
So here’s what I added to my settings.json to get the best of both worlds (light theme turned on):

			I bought a Steam Deck. I was on a waiting list that said I wouldn’t get it until this year (2023), but it arrived in October 2022.
This thing is so versatile thanks to its Desktop Mode. For games like the boomer shooters I so love, I can dock the Deck and play with a mouse and keyboard and nicer monitor. I can install Flatpaks.
The gaming experience is bar none the best.

			I kickstarted the AOKZOE A1 when I was utterly convinced that I would never get a Steam Deck.
Joke’s on me; the Deck arrived before the A1.
I primarily use this system as my sole Win11 machine, so it does a lot of light desktop work. It is also my “travel” laptop; when I’m travelling I take this and not my Steam Deck. Everything is tunable, but it draws way more power than a Deck and generally lasts about the same amount of time even with the larger battery.

			I’m not going into specs or specific details on this device. I was on an iPhone XS, which has slowly been degrading over time. Battery was slowly dying, replaced it at the Apple Store, the ribbon cable for the display was not adequately clipped back into place. It was easier to just order a new phone than to take the bus up to Emeryville again in the middle of the day for an appointment.

			One thing I love about Python’s practical approach to type annotations and enforcement is that it’s gradual: you can rapidly code a large ball of mud and get it working, then refine it to make it safer with typing later on.
Chalk this up as another good idea (possibly by accident) for Python: you can do the same with async.
At work, someone lamented that threads aren’t quite safe but they needed to do multiple http requests in parallel.

			The Python 3.10 release includes the new match statement, which superficially looks like the case/switch statements in other languages but semantically is closer to pattern matching in Haskell or Rust.
Like the walrus operator*, I struggled to find a use case for this and it seemed like a feature that was added just because the language is 30&#43; years old and all the good new functionality is taken.
However, I found a pretty good case for it that used to be a lot more work: duck-typey arguments that make default case rules easy but enable more complex functionality as needed.
