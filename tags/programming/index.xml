      <title>2023: Linux on the Desktop This Year</title>

      <description>I have a Gaming PC I bought from Costco when my wife told me &amp;ldquo;I should maybe get back into my old hobbies&amp;rdquo; in the summer of 2020. It came with Win10, which is fine and it&amp;rsquo;s probably good to have at least one Windows machine in the house at any given time.
The thing is: Windows is annoying. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run a third-party uninstall tool to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&amp;rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.</description>

      <title>VS Code: Dark Terminal on a Light Theme</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a weirdo: on my IDEs I prefer a light theme, having used light themed IDEs since time immemorial (still miss using Visual Studio regularly). But I prefer white on black for my terminal emulators, as I have used that since time immemorial and a black on white terminal window doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a serious thing.
So here&amp;rsquo;s what I added to my settings.json to get the best of both worlds (light theme turned on):</description>

      <title>Mixed Async code in Sync Python: Disappointingly Simple</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/mixed-async-disappointingly-simple/</link>

      <description>One thing I love about Python&amp;rsquo;s practical approach to type annotations and enforcement is that it&amp;rsquo;s gradual: you can rapidly code a large ball of mud and get it working, then refine it to make it safer with typing later on.
Chalk this up as another good idea (possibly by accident) for Python: you can do the same with async.
At work, someone lamented that threads aren&amp;rsquo;t quite safe but they needed to do multiple http requests in parallel.</description>

      <title>Async programming: understanding it from fundamentals</title>

      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/understanding-async-programming-from-fundamentals/</guid>
      <description>This was inspired by a short chat I had with a coworker, trying to give a simple, 15 minute explanation of something that took me a decade to wrap my head around due to poor teaching resources online.
 Async programming in modern &amp;ldquo;industrial&amp;rdquo; languages is shrouded in magic, abstractions, and years of atrocious decisions (looking at you, Javascript/Python). Most tutorials start out with &amp;ldquo;just mark your function async and await it and use these magic incantations and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go!</description>

      <description>Python has continued to progress and introduce new features and modules. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover features I haven&amp;rsquo;t used much (or at all) and how I plan on using or not using them.
Walrus Operator I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of this for a few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve found about 3 times where I&amp;rsquo;ve found it appropriate to use. It&amp;rsquo;s nice but not a huge change to the way I code. Generally in the pattern</description>

      <title>Modern Python has Changed How I Code</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t understate the importance of how much the following have changed and improved the way I write Python and have confidence in its correctness:
 Continuous Integration Black Dataclasses Mypy Type Hints  Continuous Integration This isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly new to me (or the industry), but a good CI workflow that runs tests and linting on every commit pushed to the repo tracker gives confidence that the code is clean to merge into the main branch.</description>

      <description>End product Please disregard the poor camera placement or the labels, it has since been fixed.
       Thinking Back, It Was All So Simple Now we have the system up and running, let&amp;rsquo;s talk random obstacles and next steps. This is something of an epilogue to the saga, as it&amp;rsquo;s a list of small things that accrued while working on the project.
Networks are slow and the dual tier service thing is bad, actually I initially chose to run a service on the Nginx server that then called to a service running on the RPi.</description>

      <description>Hardware The RPi The Raspberry Pi is a (I think) Pi 3 with Wifi I found in the garage with a cheap clear acrylic case. It might have been a RetroPie rig in a prior life? Or one I was &amp;ldquo;gonna get around to&amp;rdquo; doing something with and finally did?
Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.
The Printer The printer is a hefty boi, a Zebra something or other.</description>

      <description>Running the software Frontend server The frontend has three responsibilities:
 Display information Perform access control (don&amp;rsquo;t let strangers on the internet print out jobs) Forward appropriate calls to the backend  I&amp;rsquo;m using Go&amp;rsquo;s base templates for dynamic content, the Echo framework for the webapp endpoints, and plain old bare bones modern javascripto for the scripting stuff with no polyfills, no build environments, no minifiers, and boy does it feel good.</description>

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 2: Concepts and Architecture</title>

      <description>Problem Space To automate the process of printing and reporting back a ZPL payload, we need:
 A way to get the ZPL from the user A way to send the ZPL to a printer A way to take a picture A way to send it back to the user  A way to get the ZPL from the user A web service makes sense here. We want an API or a frontend (or both) to send the ZPL along and check its printing status.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my spare time on weekends in between errands and mornings before everyone wakes up, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a little project I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with: ZPL-O-Rama.
The Problem A large part of my employer&amp;rsquo;s line of business is creating shipping labels, and a large number of those aren&amp;rsquo;t simply printed images, but printed on very high volume, heavy duty, industrial grade printers using a proprietary language called ZPL.</description>

      <title>SFTP is still around and that&#39;s OK</title>

      <description>So it&amp;rsquo;s 2021 and about the entirety of my job is integrating third party systems with internal ones, which then reach out to other third-party services.
A lot of stuff uses SFTP still. In this day and age anything not on HTTP seems barbaric, but SFTP does have its advantages.
SFTP is format agnostic This goes for HTTP as well, but you need to correctly set headers, and there&amp;rsquo;s a constant, incessant push for change for change&amp;rsquo;s sake.</description>

      <title>You Don&#39;t Need to Make That Temporary File, Dude</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/dont-use-tempfiles/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/dont-use-tempfiles/</guid>
      <description>This was initially a blog post I wrote on my employer&amp;rsquo;s internal system, but it&amp;rsquo;s interestingly useful and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any trade secrets so I figure I&amp;rsquo;ll share.
 A common pattern that seems obvious when you need to shuttle data around in file form is to use a temporary file against the filesystem using the tempfile module.
You very seldom ACTUALLY need to do this. The BytesIO class follows the exact same protocol, the file protocol, so any API that accepts a &amp;ldquo;file-like object&amp;rdquo; will accept an in-memory piece of information in addition to a file on disk.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&amp;rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.</description>

      <description>For as much shit as I like to talk about C++, I sure can get a lot done quite efficiently in it.
I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the with statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.</description>

      <description>I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&amp;quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.
I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new.</description>
