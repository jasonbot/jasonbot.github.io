      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Rectangle window manager for mac for the last couple of weeks and it&amp;rsquo;s been the most helpful thing since Mission Control (and setting up a hot corner to activate it).
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use full tiling managers before but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.</description>

      <description>I have two desktop systems, side-by-side: an Intel Mac Mini and an Intel 21&amp;quot; iMac. The Mini runs Leopard and the iMac runs Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and I find myself completely satisfied with the Linux desktop, and switch back to OSX as an auxiliary rather than as my primary.
I started on Debian back in 1999. I wanted to get into Linux, but both Red Hat and SuSE were a little hard to get going for beginners, and the packages supplied were always a weird grab bag of old and new.</description>
