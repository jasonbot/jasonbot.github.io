      <description>I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.
Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.</description>

      <description>February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In restrospect it&amp;rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.</description>

      <description>This is a recycled post from my tumblr weblog. I&amp;rsquo;ve since had three other jobs, but a lot of what I like still rings true 5 years later in 2020.
 Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&amp;rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&amp;rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco.</description>
