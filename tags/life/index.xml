      <title>The 2020s and the Post-Office World</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/the-post-office-world/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did poorly doing remote work in 2012 when I first tried it and didn&amp;rsquo;t look forward to doing it again. A big part of my day was framed around a commute, a large part of my productivity are 3 minute snippets of conversation with random people on the elevator to get an idea for what I could provide my coworkers, the majority of my socialization is in the context of work, and a large part of my sanity was my enthusiasm for figuring out byzantine ways to get around solely by public transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home has been varied as I adjust to it and go through cycles of acceptance, as well as the variance in the openness of the Bay Area. At one point places were open, which was great, and appointment based, which was even better because there was limited admittance and things were empty enough to appreciate in a way we hadn&amp;rsquo;t before. The SF and Oakland Zoos, 2 of my kid&amp;rsquo;s favorite places, were noticeably better experiences until they locked down and shut again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m adjusting to working from home I am noting probably the same things everyone else is: that work/home boundaries are hard, that having a dedicated workspace is essential, and keeping a routine &lt;em&gt;with good sleep hygiene&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely paramount to not breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit of the events of 2020 was that I lost over 40 pounds &amp;ndash; no more being too tired to cook 3 nights a week and ordering out. No more eating a $20 lunch in the Financial District at a restaurant every day. No more cocktails on Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit was saving money &amp;ndash; hundreds of dollars a month in eating out, hundreds of dollars in gas, hundreds of dollars on my Clipper card, hundreds of dollars in things like movie tickets and indoor playground fees. With that we were able to save more aggressively, and with our extra time able to do paperwork and visit house showings, so we were able to pounce and buy a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little reluctant to buy a home in the Bay Area initially because &amp;ldquo;everyone is leaving,&amp;rdquo; but exoduses have happened here before and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate things will stay like this forever, at the worst we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait a decade. Our lifestyles won&amp;rsquo;t go entirely back to 2019, but people like living in cities and having interesting things to do nearby, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure even if the lucky Millennials who can afford it are permanently committing to the suburbs the next generation will cycle back and flock back to major cities and their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new office is my garage &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re going to put in the money to turn it into a mock office, complete with a sealed &amp;ldquo;phone booth&amp;rdquo; room and cubicle-like partitions. Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s just a garage with a couple of desks that I share with the Christmas decorations, but it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere where my work life is separate from my home life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been weird, but it&amp;rsquo;s been weird for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Years in the Bay Area</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/five-years-in-the-bay/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 06:25:45 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/five-years-in-the-bay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In retrospect it&amp;rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;culture&#34;&gt;Culture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;professional-development&#34;&gt;Professional Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bay Area is a terrible echo chamber full of tech magpies who cling onto the newest shiny thing, it&amp;rsquo;s also been good to be on that cutting edge and see it for what it is: it&amp;rsquo;s not a holy priesthood of people Up There going to meetups you have to &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; get recorded and put online a month later, it&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to get back into web development after years of being out of it and the landscape has changed a lot but all the fundamentals are the same. The &lt;code&gt;Referer&lt;/code&gt; HTTP header still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quality-of-life&#34;&gt;Quality of Life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality of life is a mixed bag. It&amp;rsquo;s crowded and expensive, but there&amp;rsquo;s stuff to do. We basically throw an entire paycheck into our apartment and single car, but I can take public transit everywhere and we&amp;rsquo;re an hour away from Napa. Now that we&amp;rsquo;re parents we appreciate the suburban wasteland that is the Inland Empire as a good place for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Like About My New Job</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/things-i-like-about-my-new-job/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2015 19:55:10 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/things-i-like-about-my-new-job/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;https://jason.cleanstick.net/post/118755320730/things-i-like-about-my-new-job&#34;&gt;a recycled post from my tumblr weblog&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve since had three other jobs, but a lot of what I like still rings true 5 years later in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; like about most of my prior employers so don&amp;rsquo;t expect any negative posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco. I&amp;rsquo;ve been here about three months now and this is a list of (some) of the things I like about my new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: This is something that I took for granted almost a decade ago at a former employer and haven&amp;rsquo;t had since. When I make a change and push it to GitHub, a set of tests automatically spin up and I can&amp;rsquo;t merge to master until those tests pass. This is good, I have a self-service QA agent where I can iteratively work on an issue and finally do a PR when it&amp;rsquo;s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual Decent Test Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s a test suite built in to the code, not saved as an auxiliary repository. When the codebase has a decent set of tests it helps you make sure your changes don&amp;rsquo;t break anything, and it also works to make you feel guilty if you aren&amp;rsquo;t keeping the coverage levels up with your new code, creating a virtuous cycle of test writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Reviews that Actually Happen&lt;/strong&gt;: The tooling for deploys is set up so that no code can be merged into the master branch until it gets a code review/thumbs up by at least one other non-author developer. Code can&amp;rsquo;t be checked in, period, unless it&amp;rsquo;s been hit by at least two sets of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Can Ship a Feature Same-Day&lt;/strong&gt;: Assuming the feature is small enough, you could sit down at 9:00 AM, implement a feature, write tests, get it code reviewed and have the code shipping by 5:00 PM to real live clients. It was frustrating waiting 16+ months to ship features/fixes at the last place, it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to get immediate feedback on my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CTO/Cofounder Still Writes Code&lt;/strong&gt;: Certainly he doesn&amp;rsquo;t write the same volume of code he did when there were 4 developers, but the fact that the CTO still finds time to write code/add features to the product shows upper management actually cares about what&amp;rsquo;s under the hood of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Silos&lt;/strong&gt;: There are functional teams, and there are specialists, but for the most part everyone works transparently. Meeting notes from each meeting go to an email alias everyone is subscribed to, all GitHub repos are accessible by every engineer, if you want to know how something works all you have to do is look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up-to-Date Documents&lt;/strong&gt;: We use a Wiki and we&amp;rsquo;ve got people engaged enough and motivated enough to tend to it like a garden. No 5-year-old Word documents hiding as sharepoint attachments that require you to ask 5 people to see what&amp;rsquo;s no longer true/correct. If anyone finds a set of instructions confusing on a page, they go in and change it so they&amp;rsquo;re less confusing/more correct for the next person, which leads to the next point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Something&amp;rsquo;s Broken, You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Permission to Fix It&lt;/strong&gt;: We get used to little and big annoyances in every software product we use. When I first started I was a little timid about suggesting fixes, figuring things were the way they were for a reason. I&amp;rsquo;m learning now that I can fix annoyances with impunity—nobody gets mad if you make the software better, even if it&amp;rsquo;s in code you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally be responsible for. They&amp;rsquo;re thankful, in fact. We&amp;rsquo;ve just begun to formalize this in &amp;lsquo;Spring Cleaning:&amp;rsquo; one day a month we just work on back burner/wish list items. And it&amp;rsquo;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Want to Do More, Do More&lt;/strong&gt;: This is fairly straightforward: if you want to learn something new, go ahead and do it. If you want to be responsible for X, start working on X. No need for formal requests or transfers. As a riff on the above, if you want to do it, do it. This is a fantastic way to work and makes it possible to do professional development in all sorts of directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/strong&gt;: This is more a living in the Bay Area thing. In Redlands my strategy for making a painless commute was to live as close as possible to work. Now my strategy is to just live near a train station. My commute from near SFO up to the Caltrain station in SF is about 25 minutes most mornings. In that time I can read or use my laptop, rather than feather my clutch in stop-and-go traffic and scream at other drivers. It&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officially Sanctioned Social Events&lt;/strong&gt;: Hearsay Social puts on little social events all the time. It&amp;rsquo;s the best way to learn what other people are up to and to form bonds outside of meetings and email. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice getting to know your coworkers in this manner and makes things smoother while actually working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unofficially Sanctioned Social Events&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of people have common interests and like each other enough to organize small group activities. Some people do rock climbing or go to amusement parks or do a weekly board game night. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The People&lt;/strong&gt;: As a San Francisco tech startup, the people skew a little younger than I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but everyone is smart and reasonable and easy to talk to. There&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;watch out for that guy&amp;rdquo; warnings because there are no &amp;ldquo;that guy&amp;quot;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I&amp;rsquo;m glad I came up and I&amp;rsquo;m happy with Hearsay Social.&lt;/p&gt;
