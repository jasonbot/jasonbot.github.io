      <title>The Wrong Conclusion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common pattern I have come to recognize everywhere as an anti-pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person starts a dialogue establishing a problem, upon which we all agree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person continues on down the same line of conversation, outlining a solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person comes to a conclusion which is a call to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this a lot because step 1 seems to short-circuit the thinking behind the rest of the logic. You got a narrative going that you feel compelled to continue to listen to, and assume it&amp;rsquo;s only going to stay sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;just because you have identified a problem does not mean your solution is correct&lt;/strong&gt;. Stop yourself when a person opens a paragraph and remember that &lt;em&gt;where they are going is not necessarily the only path, or even a sensible one&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example I see most currently is about AI somehow matching human intelligence, usually in the context of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs exist, and seem to have novel properties that mimic humans producing language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, LLMs are the same as humans producing language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, LLMs have all the other capacities of humans and have been endowed with human nature and will replace us all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decorated these talking points with some straw men that are usually left implicit when the idea is presented, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you agree with the problem statement does not mean that the conclusion is correct just because it occurs a few sentences later.&lt;/p&gt;
