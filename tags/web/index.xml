      <title>If Your Electron App is &#34;Just A Browser Wrapper&#34; You&#39;re Doing It Wrong</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having spent the last 6 months working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.com/desktop&#34;&gt;an Electron app full-time&lt;/a&gt;, my Stockholm Syndrome has kicked in and I&amp;rsquo;ve come around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to disparagingly refer to an Electron app as bloated, or a crappy wrapper around a web app. This is lazy, reductive thinking that travels well in short-form media like TikTok and Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;𝕏: The Everything App&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this in so many words over and over: do you hate Electron out of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groupthink,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of misguided and impractical engineering aesthetics, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because you would prefer the &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; apps you see written in it to not exist at all, over existing but being &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, is the framework that allows bad apps to proliferate &lt;em&gt;bad on its own&lt;/em&gt; for enabling bad programmers or &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for enabling &lt;em&gt;skilled and unskilled programmers alike&lt;/em&gt; to participate in software engineering? Or &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my oh my do I love being ambivalent on everything and I want to pass that along to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;electron-isnt-just-a-browser-wrapper&#34;&gt;Electron Isn&amp;rsquo;t Just A Browser Wrapper&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from wrapping a web page, though, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app&#34;&gt;a whole truckload of stuff&lt;/a&gt; to make a carefully and comprehensively written Electron app &lt;em&gt;actually good&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Window creation and management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menus, you know, like system menus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom tray icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dock icon overlays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Touchbar customizations (RIP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opting to run the app on startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending crash reports to interested parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing additional native code in native languages like C++ and Rust via Node extensions &lt;em&gt;that give better platform-specific runtime characteristics&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use the native filesystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use native builds of machine learning libraries versus hoping you&amp;rsquo;re patient enough to watch them run slower and worse in Webassembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of a sudden things that ran slow on your computer or non-privately on some SaaS company&amp;rsquo;s server are happening quickly and efficiently &lt;em&gt;on your hardware&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;your desk&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;no network round-trips&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more! And after all this, it happens to let you place rectangles in those windows that are views into the Chromium rendering engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an Electron app you&amp;rsquo;re using doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; mostly native, it&amp;rsquo;s more an indictment of the nature of the people making the app than the framework they&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of Electron is to provide a decent, native desktop experience and uses HTML/CSS/Javascript as its core language for user interface and the Nodejs runtime and its ecosystem behind the curtain. Familiar tools, fast development. In some cases, this development is only &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; via Electron: when you can reuse half your codebase you&amp;rsquo;re halfway there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-operating-system-webview-is-a-lie-and-a-nightmare-and-probably-worse-than-nothing&#34;&gt;The Operating System Webview is a Lie and a Nightmare and Probably Worse than Nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words in the subheading immediately above about cover it. I was using another webview-based framework (who cares which) for &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeberg.org/jasonbot/ollama-desktop-with-wails&#34;&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; and I had a pretty cool UX with sidebar tabs that rendered vertically to save space via &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/text-orientation&#34;&gt;text orientation&lt;/a&gt;. The webviews in 50% of the platforms I tested didn&amp;rsquo;t do this, they rendered the text horizontally, breaking my UI. Flexbox wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully there. Some of the platforms (Linux) didn&amp;rsquo;t even support changing fonts &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now had another variable I had close to zero control over regarding my rendering engine. I now had web technologies, inconsistently applied, that I had to &lt;em&gt;extensively&lt;/em&gt; test on every platform. I could not trust my UI to be a UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging a rendering engine gives me guarantees of rendering capabilities independent of the operating system&amp;rsquo;s webview. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell a paying customer &amp;ldquo;sorry man that&amp;rsquo;s just the way it is on Windows 10&amp;rdquo; with a straight face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;bloat-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder&#34;&gt;Bloat is in the Eye of the Beholder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-youre-distributing-containerized-apps-or-static-binaries-youre-just-as-guilty-of-the-original-sin-of-electron-bloat&#34;&gt;If You&amp;rsquo;re Distributing Containerized Apps or Static Binaries You&amp;rsquo;re Just As Guilty of the Original Sin of Electron Bloat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; back at home. An Electron installation doesn&amp;rsquo;t use system libraries. This is a conscious choice. An Electron app comes batteries included. You can afford 250 megs of HD space for an app you use daily, you disk cheapskate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron bundles all that inside itself. It&amp;rsquo;s the equivalent to a static binary that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the system libc. It&amp;rsquo;s the equivalent to a full-blown, dozen-gigabyte Ubuntu system used as an image base just to host a single web app process in a container. You accept batteries included software elsewhere: don&amp;rsquo;t be a hypocrite and complain in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-you-sure-youre-reading-the-task-manager-correctly&#34;&gt;Are You Sure You&amp;rsquo;re Reading the Task Manager Correctly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAM column on the task manager is showing how much memory the Electron process has asked the Operating System to put aside for it. Keep in mind, in any operating system released since the 1990s this &lt;em&gt;does not mean there is dedicated hardware RAM allocated to it&lt;/em&gt;. The process may have pre-allocated a gig because it anticipates needing it but hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet, and that &amp;ldquo;memory&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t all in RAM anyway: it swaps out into page files on disk when unused! The OS could be managing 4GB for the process but only a few hundred megs of that is being actively accessed in hardware short-term Random Access Memory, the rest being paged out to disk. Operating systems are also clever enough to say &amp;ldquo;you asked for a 2 gig page but haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to allocate it until you do. I just know you have dibs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard Electron is being upfront about how much storage it&amp;rsquo;s using and that storage is ephemeral: the task manager app doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you how much disk space an app has permanently written to disk. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; tell you how much RAM the app is &amp;lsquo;borrowing&amp;rsquo; and will return when it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-processes--more-bad-is-just-a-silly-take&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;More processes&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;More Bad&amp;rdquo; is Just a Silly Take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also be angry that Electron has more than one line in Task Manager. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s an Electron Worker Process?&amp;rdquo; you say. &amp;ldquo;Why does it need so many?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, weird take and I think it&amp;rsquo;s just surface-level &amp;ldquo;too many lines on the UI&amp;rdquo; type knee-jerk reaction. Processes are for safety! Two blocks of code are isolated from each other as separate processes so if one goes down the other does not. Electron has this because Chromium has this because some web developers are maniacs and write code that take down the entire browser, so now the blast radius is limited to a single browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern operating systems, again, are excellent at handling large numbers of processes. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly valid bit of software engineering to have child processes. Processes are not your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;its-a-way-safer-bet-to-just-use-html-for-ui&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Way Safer Bet to Just Use HTML for UI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;longevity&#34;&gt;Longevity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML and Javascript have a long, unbroken 30+ year lineage in which improvements have been additive: never destructive (except maybe the demise of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;marquee/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and never a full fork (except that now-extinct misadventure into XHTML).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C is run by the most bureaucratic, glacially-paced working groups sponsored by the most hatefully pedantic employees at the largest, most inertia-driven tech companies in the world. This means that toy features that are unlikely to have a long lifespan won&amp;rsquo;t get into the working spec. A bunch of orgs all have to agree to implement the feature in their parallel implementations before the feature&amp;rsquo;s really considered usable. None of us is as obstructive as all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only extant UI frameworks I am aware of with the same relative longevity are X11 and Win32, and neither of them have been capable of the degree and pace of modernization that HTML/CSS/JS have had. (I will include QT in a respectable but distant third place here after Win32 and X).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you that picking whatever &amp;ldquo;rapid&amp;rdquo; XAML horror Microsoft is currently pushing is a bad idea! You&amp;rsquo;re going to need specialists who are hard to find to work on it when it is discontinued for the Next XAML Horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;portability&#34;&gt;Portability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes without saying: Chromium runs on every major platform. Most browser engines outside of Chromium are also multiplatform (Firefox, Servo, Ladybird). The part that draws the pixels on the screen draws the pixels the same everywhere. It covers the whole &amp;ldquo;exposing OS native components in a cross platform way,&amp;rdquo; up to and including accessibility mechanisms built on OS-level buttons and text. It&amp;rsquo;s a good way of describing user experience in code that works pretty well on every modern device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-the-only-realistic-way-you-clowns-are-getting-anything-nice-on-linux&#34;&gt;This is the Only Realistic Way you Clowns are Getting Anything Nice on Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a volunteer open source enthusiast, I can see myself pouring hours of love and care into a Linux-only app that faithfully and elegantly follows the Gnome HIG. I cannot see myself doing this for a paycheck. I am willing to endure that pain for the sake of my art, but not for the sake of closing out issues for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy ports from Win/Mac to Linux are the most likely way you&amp;rsquo;re going to see your app on Linux, and Electron is probability-wise the most likely way to get there. I can&amp;rsquo;t justify putting more than 1% of my work hours on builds that only reach 1% of our user base. I just can&amp;rsquo;t do that at work. If I can get 75% overlap for Linux by parasitizing my Windows and Mac dev time via Electron, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to get a Linux app. If it&amp;rsquo;s just another build target with a very small amount, hopefully 1% total, on platform specific issues, you have a chance of seeing it on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hiring&#34;&gt;Hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations are risk averse. This means they want interchangeable resources to avoid bottlenecks. Humans are resources, just ask your Human Resources department. Being able to pull from the largest possible pool of frontend engineers with no training required is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also an inconsiderate move to trap your engineers in dead-end technologies. If a replaceable frontend engineer has 5 years of fully non-transferable experience on your proprietary frontend, when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; throw them away due to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; idiot budget decisions &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have to write off 5 years of their lives on their resumes. That framework isn&amp;rsquo;t applicable elsewhere. Boo on you, you monsters. Using an industry standard, &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; framework is &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; for employee and organization both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron is a low risk way for large organizations to add desktop features to something that originated on the web (probably a Node/React boilerplate app that grew past its original purposes, let&amp;rsquo;s not lie). You need to ask yourself the question when you see a bad Electron app: is this better than nothing? Did Electron simply allow the app developers to unleash a usability nightmare on you? Or did it enable them to provide a nice, uniform, &lt;em&gt;native-enough feeling&lt;/em&gt; application that might be bulky and aesthetically unpleasing from a software engineering perspective but is in practice a workable experience?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 5: Postscript</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-5/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-5/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;end-product&#34;&gt;End product&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please disregard the poor camera placement or the labels, it has since been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/images/zpl-o-rama/workflow-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Step 1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/images/zpl-o-rama/workflow-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Step 2&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/images/zpl-o-rama/workflow-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Step 3&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;thinking-back-it-was-all-so-simple&#34;&gt;Thinking Back, It Was All So Simple&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have the system up and running, let&amp;rsquo;s talk random obstacles and next steps. This is something of an epilogue to the saga, as it&amp;rsquo;s a list of small things that accrued while working on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;networks-are-slow-and-the-dual-tier-service-thing-is-bad-actually&#34;&gt;Networks are slow and the dual tier service thing is bad, actually&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially chose to run a service on the Nginx server that then called to a service running on the RPi. Since there were Very Large PNGs being shuttled around a LOT, this was inefficient from a speed perspective because of the bandwidth consumed over my shitty cable connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two band-aids I&amp;rsquo;ve applied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moved both services to the RPi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started sending out a version of the image by default shrunken to 800px wide, with the original full size image as an optional download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could merge the two services into one, but having the backend be &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;able without any sort of auth makes it easy to test the two ends more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;networks-are-unreliable&#34;&gt;Networks are unreliable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSH tunnel can go down and while I have taken efforts to mitigate it, I could take more. Currently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting timeouts in the SSH tunnel service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Force resetting the tunnel every 6 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally I could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run another task that tries to hit a healthcheck on the zpl service, and if it&amp;rsquo;s dead restart the tunnel service unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same idea but with my cable internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-a-sequence-of-disappointments-and-confusion-until-it-usually-ends-anticlimactically-in-a-whimper&#34;&gt;Life is a sequence of disappointments and confusion until it (usually) ends anticlimactically in a whimper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just gotta do what you can do a day at a time, man.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 4: The Hardware</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-4/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rpi&#34;&gt;The RPi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a (I think) Pi 3 with Wifi I found in the garage with a cheap clear acrylic case. It might have been a RetroPie rig in a prior life? Or one I was &amp;ldquo;gonna get around to&amp;rdquo; doing something with and finally did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for this project I bought a Raspberry Pi camera and a small acrylic case for it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-printer&#34;&gt;The Printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer is a hefty boi, a Zebra something or other. It belongs to work. It has an ethernet port, a lot of lights, an air of proprietary grandeur, and a hunger for paper and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-assembled-rig&#34;&gt;THE ASSEMBLED RIG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted all the components to be as easy to transport as possible, so I used adhesive velcro tape to affix the components to each other and some adhesive cable maangement clips to hold the cables in place, carefult to leave enough slack so that the side dfoor can still open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi is running stock Raspian, I have the Pi connected to the printer via a short span of Cat 6 I found, and I&amp;rsquo;m using dnsmasq&amp;rsquo;s dhcp bound to &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt; so that the printer always gets the same IP that the Pi can address it through. The Pi joins my network via WiFi. The intent is for the whole mess to be easy to pick up and move around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece is a humble power strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture of the front (you can see some of the cable management):

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it&amp;rsquo;s set up:

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 3: Software</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;running-the-software&#34;&gt;Running the software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-server&#34;&gt;Frontend server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontend has three responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform access control (don&amp;rsquo;t let strangers on the internet print out jobs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward appropriate calls to the backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using Go&amp;rsquo;s base templates for dynamic content, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://echo.labstack.com/&#34;&gt;Echo framework&lt;/a&gt; for the webapp endpoints, and plain old bare bones modern javascripto for the scripting stuff with no polyfills, no build environments, no minifiers, and boy does it feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page is fast and I am attempting to capitalize on the whole &amp;ldquo;Hotwire&amp;rdquo; trend by using &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; for some stuff on pages. Look how leader my thoughts are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary. The pages themselves render blazingly fast since they are so resource lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-server&#34;&gt;Backend server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend server is a simple Go server with an even simpler API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Endpoint&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Purpose&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/print&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Enqueues a print job and returns a unique ID&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/job/:id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Returns the status of the job, along with the image if it&amp;rsquo;s been taken&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing to be aware of is that only one job can be running at a time. The way we get around this is very simple: a single goroutine waiting for jobs running in a loop. That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s the synchronization mechanism. A goroutine and a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs are stored in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/boltdb/bolt&#34;&gt;Bolt&lt;/a&gt; database, which has all the ACID properties I want in a database while being stupid simple to use. Like, easier than Sqlite. I know, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;login-management&#34;&gt;Login Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lives entirely on the frontend. I&amp;rsquo;m using Google&amp;rsquo;s javascript OAuth2 library along with some backend whitelisting to only allow people with approved Google logins into the privileged endpoints. Permissions are enforced via a custom Echo middleware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-aside-making-peace-with-systemd&#34;&gt;An aside: Making Peace with &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like to talk shit about &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s weird, it&amp;rsquo;s disruptive, it tries to do too much.
First off, at least it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html&#34;&gt;launchd&lt;/a&gt;, and second, this is a project for my entertainment and I find it fun to do interesting things despite the environment I&amp;rsquo;m running in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;operating-environment-on-the-server&#34;&gt;Operating Environment on the Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/&#34;&gt;letsencrypt&lt;/a&gt; for SSL, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/compute&#34;&gt;GCP for a VM/IP&lt;/a&gt; (Docker would be stupid here), and Nginx as the edge. The conf look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nginx&#34; data-lang=&#34;nginx&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically: use HTTPS, pass through to the frontend service which is bound to a port on localhost via the tunnel. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;operating-environment-on-the-pi&#34;&gt;Operating Environment on the Pi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a custom user with limited permissions called &lt;code&gt;zplorama&lt;/code&gt;. I had to add it to the group &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; so it could call &lt;code&gt;raspistill&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two service executables operate via simple systemd unit defs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly simple: run a binary as a specific user in a specific path, restart on fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is super simple and since I&amp;rsquo;m embedding the config inside the binaries I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to send any command-line flags along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tunnel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ssh connection stays alive via another systemd unit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;multi-user.target&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment involves doing a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;make clean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cp ./bin/ ~zplorama/bin&lt;/code&gt;, and then using &lt;code&gt;sudo service restart&lt;/code&gt;. This could be a script, even!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#! /bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; zpl-o-rama
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git pull
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;make clean &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; make
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo mv bin/* ~zplorama/bin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo chown zplorama:zplorama ~zplorama/bin/*
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; service in zplbackend zplfrontend zpltunnel
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  sudo service restart &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;end&#34;&gt;End&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beefiest of the posts because it includes real code. TL;DR: the configuration of the service is larger than the actual code of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 2: Concepts and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem-space&#34;&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automate the process of printing and reporting back a ZPL payload, we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to get the ZPL from the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to send the ZPL to a printer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to take a picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to send it back to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-way-to-get-the-zpl-from-the-user&#34;&gt;A way to get the ZPL from the user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web service makes sense here. We want an API or a frontend (or both) to send the ZPL along and check its printing status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-way-to-send-the-zpl-to-a-printer&#34;&gt;A way to send the ZPL to a printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ZPL printer has an ethernet port and can simply be &lt;code&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt;ted to. We just need a program that shuttles ZPL from user to printer. This can easily be done with a web API and maybe something like a Raspberry pi in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-way-to-take-a-picture&#34;&gt;A way to take a picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pis have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/&#34;&gt;cheap camra modules&lt;/a&gt; with dedicated ports to accept them on the board. There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md&#34;&gt;a simple command-line app&lt;/a&gt; to capture stills. This is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-way-to-send-it-back-to-the-user&#34;&gt;A way to send it back to the user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably going to be the same thing as above, with the webapp. The printer prints, the camera cams, the webapp reconveys the image to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we abstractly have all the conceptual parts we&amp;rsquo;ll need to make this service thought out. Now for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-talk-architecture&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I needed to do was plan out how this would work. I made a diagram to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t missing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/images/zpl-o-rama/zpl-o-rama-architecture.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Architecture Diagram&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll use Nginx at the edge to route to a frontend application. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll forward to a backend application which is running on my Raspberry pi which handles the printing/photography step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll present the user a nice web service hosted on a machine on the cloud with a Real Internet IP where the user can log in, enter ZPL, and see the output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ZPL-O-Rama Part 1: A personal/work project (Introduction)</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/zpl-o-rama-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my spare time on weekends in between errands and mornings before everyone wakes up, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a little project I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with: ZPL-O-Rama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of my employer&amp;rsquo;s line of business is creating shipping labels, and a large number of those aren&amp;rsquo;t simply printed images, but printed on very high volume, heavy duty, industrial grade printers using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/manuals/printers/common/programming/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf&#34;&gt;a proprietary language called ZPL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an aggressive and justified act of Intellectual Property enforcement, there are no legal software ZPL renderers available&lt;sup&gt;(footnote 1)&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that to test the output of a ZPL stanza we have to physically print a label and inspect it. In the Before Times of 2019, our office was full of all kinds of ZPL printer we could freely and cavalierly print to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that workplaces are in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/thepost-office-world&#34;&gt;post-office diaspora&lt;/a&gt;, we no longer have access to ZPL printers. The fleet of printers were  dispatched to a number of people in the org who opted in and had a vested need to test ZPL. I was one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for those without a printer, if they need to test something they will go into a Slack channel and hope someone sees it in a timely manner, prints the ZPL, takes a picture, and reports back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do better than that. We can automate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnotes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; (Yes, I am aware of &lt;a href=&#34;http://labelary.com/viewer.html&#34;&gt;Labelary&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;rsquo;s also proprietary and probably in violation of all kinds of agreements)&lt;/p&gt;
