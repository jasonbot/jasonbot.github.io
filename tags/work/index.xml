      <title>The 2020s and the Post-Office World</title>

      <description>I moved to the Bay Area 6 years ago after stubbornly refusing to for over a decade before because I wanted to be in the middle of the world of software. 2020 made some of that luster wear off.
Our office closed at the end of March, 2020, for what was scheduled to be 2 months, which eventually stretched out into over 6 months, until finally we were told to clean off our desks by Thanksgiving as we were permanently remote.</description>

      <title>Own your infrastructure</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&amp;rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.</description>

      <description>I gave a short (~10) minute talk on preparing to move to microservices at the Python meetup in San Francisco.
The main points:
 We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&amp;rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice  </description>

      <title>What I Like About My New Job</title>

      <description>This is a recycled post from my tumblr weblog. I&amp;rsquo;ve since had three other jobs, but a lot of what I like still rings true 5 years later in 2020.
 Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&amp;rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&amp;rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco.</description>
