      <title>Trying out PaperWM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an enthusiast of playing around with different window management schemes. I like the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of a tiling window manager, but I&amp;rsquo;m not smart enough to ever get really productive in something like i3 or sway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the past few years &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/trying-out-rectangle/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Rectangle on MacOS&lt;/a&gt; as something of a band-aid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7065/tiling-shell/&#34;&gt;the Tiling WM Extension ion Gnome&lt;/a&gt; for a while, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty happy with it. It does a good job of emulating &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241&#34;&gt;one of the better features on Win11&lt;/a&gt;, a progressive way to arrange windows in an ordered way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6099/paperwm/&#34;&gt;trying out PaperWM&lt;/a&gt;. The concept simplifies and streamlines windows fro occupying a fully two dimensional space into something resembling 1.5 dimensions: windows are all arranged side-by-side infinitely, and you just traverse along the line of windows to find what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it full time for a week and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with it. Maybe this will stick for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2024-11-22:&lt;/strong&gt; PaperWS hard crashes when I launch games that try to switch to fullscreen from Steam. Back to the drawing board!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2023: Linux on the Desktop This Year</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/linux-on-the-desktop-2023/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gaming PC I bought from Costco when my wife told me &amp;ldquo;I should maybe get back into my old hobbies&amp;rdquo; in the summer of 2020. It came with Win10, which is fine and it&amp;rsquo;s probably good to have at least one Windows machine in the house at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is: Windows is &lt;em&gt;annoying&lt;/em&gt;. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-&#34;&gt;a third-party uninstall tool&lt;/a&gt; to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&amp;rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a flood in the winter of 2022. Our new home office was under half an inch of water and many of my electronics were unsalvageably water damaged. I placed this gaming machine (which hardly got any usage anyway) outside to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case then accrued condensation inside, which convinced me this thing was now, if it had not been previously, fully water damaged e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April I was bored and wanted to see if I could at least save the hard drives before taking the machine to recycling. On a lark I tried to turn in on and surprise surprise, it booted no problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had already written it off as &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; I figured it was fine to put Linux on it. I had read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nobaraproject.org/&#34;&gt;Nobara Linux&lt;/a&gt; as it was done by the same guy who does a bunch of Proton and SteamOS hacking, and it had a bunch of quality of life improvements to make it gaming friendly: it even had the Steam client installed out of the box. Once I got over my distaste of using a non-.deb based distro I was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Gnome desktop. This ships with a newer version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole &amp;ldquo;I need at least one Windows machine in the house&amp;rdquo; thing: Proton plays all my games. Steam on here does 95% of what I need. TYhe only Windows app I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xara.com/photo-graphic-plus/&#34;&gt;Xara&lt;/a&gt;, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it or its lineage since 1999 and I have muscle memory. Every attempt I&amp;rsquo;ve made in every flavor of Wine has failed, and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xaraxtreme.org/&#34;&gt;the Linux versions they briefly released&lt;/a&gt; are now too bit-rotted to be usable on a modern installation on an x64 machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Wine mostly has me covered, but for that single app I&amp;rsquo;m now using &lt;a href=&#34;https://virt-manager.org/&#34;&gt;virt-manager&lt;/a&gt; to handle a single Win10 install. It it&amp;rsquo;s got a very small footprint and it runs my programs and is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; a better idea than an Win7 or XP VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Nobara has been fine for the past several months. I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions&#34;&gt;VS Code as an RPM source&lt;/a&gt;, I just download Go as &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; and plop it into &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, Python via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&#34;&gt;PyEnv&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install&#34;&gt;google cloud command line apps&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://flathub.org/en&#34;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; has turned out to be this amazing dark horse over the past 3 years to find decent software in a distro-independent fashion. The only annoyance remaining is that there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional double-buffering-flicker thing that pops up on 3d accelerated UI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
