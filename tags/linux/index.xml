      <title>2023: Linux on the Desktop This Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Gaming PC I bought from Costco when my wife told me &amp;ldquo;I should maybe get back into my old hobbies&amp;rdquo; in the summer of 2020. It came with Win10, which is fine and it&amp;rsquo;s probably good to have at least one Windows machine in the house at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is: Windows is &lt;em&gt;annoying&lt;/em&gt;. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-&#34;&gt;a third-party uninstall tool&lt;/a&gt; to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&amp;rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a flood in the winter of 2022. Our new home office was under half an inch of water and many of my electronics were unsalvageably water damaged. I placed this gaming machine (which hardly got any usage anyway) outside to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case then accrued condensation inside, which cvonvinved me this thing was now, if it had not been previously, fully water damaged e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April I was bored and wanted to see if I could at least save the hard drives before taking the machine to recycling. On a lark I tried to turn in on and surprise surprise, it booted no problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had already written it off as &amp;ldquo;dead,&amp;rdquo; I figured it was fine to put Linux on it. I had read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nobaraproject.org/&#34;&gt;Nobara Linux&lt;/a&gt; as it was done by the same guy who does a bunch of Proton and SteamOS hacking, and it had a bunch of quality of life improvements to make it gaming friendly: it even had the Steam client installed out of the box. Once I got over my distaste of using a non-.deb based distro I was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Gnome desktop. This ships with a newer version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole &amp;ldquo;I need at least one Windows machine in the house&amp;rdquo; thing: Proton plays all my games. Steam on here does 95% of what I need. TYhe only Windows app I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xara.com/photo-graphic-plus/&#34;&gt;Xara&lt;/a&gt;, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it or its lineage since 1999 and I have muscle memory. Every attempt I&amp;rsquo;ve made in every flavor of Wine has failed, and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xaraxtreme.org/&#34;&gt;the Linux versions they briefly released&lt;/a&gt; are now too bit-rotted to be usable on a modern installation on an x64 machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Wine mostly has me covered, but for that single app I&amp;rsquo;m now using &lt;a href=&#34;https://virt-manager.org/&#34;&gt;virt-manager&lt;/a&gt; to handle a single &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/tiny-10-NTDEV&#34;&gt;Tiny10&lt;/a&gt; install, which is a custom &amp;ldquo;remix&amp;rdquo; of Windows that is so bare bones that it&amp;rsquo;s not even possible to install the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/terminal&#34;&gt;new Windows terminal&lt;/a&gt; on. But it&amp;rsquo;s got a very small footprint and it runs my programs and is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; a better idea than an XP VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Nobara has been fine for the past several months. I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions&#34;&gt;VS Code as an RPM source&lt;/a&gt;, I just download Go as &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; and plop it into &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, Python via &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv&lt;/code&gt;, google cloud command line apps, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://flathub.org/en&#34;&gt;Flatpak&lt;/a&gt; has turned out to be this amazing dark horse over the past 3 years to find decent software in a distro-independent fashion, the only annoyance remaining is that there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional double-buffering-flicker thing that pops up on 3d accelerated UI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
