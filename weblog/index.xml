      <title>Pinebook Pro: The Tinkering Laptop</title>

      <description>As the parent of an almost three year old, I don&amp;rsquo;t get much time to myself, and I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on video games that don&amp;rsquo;t have playtimes under 15 minutes (that discounts anything with load times or cutscenes). In my spare time I have to find other things to do that are low impact and can be cut into small amounts of time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to watching a lot of retrocomputing stuff on YouTube, which has inspired me to tinker with old software and resource constrained devices.</description>

      <title>My Dingus Chromebook still works</title>

      <description>So I bought that dang Chromebook over three years ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.</description>

      <title>Five Years in the Bay Area</title>

      <description>February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In restrospect it&amp;rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.
Culture Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have theoretically done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.</description>

      <title>Own your infrastructure</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sharecropping on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s server farms since I moved to the Bay Area 5 years ago. That is, every startup I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for has utilized AWS (and sometimes GCP or Azure in addition).
This started out great for my career because I have not built a server machine from parts out since I was in college and I could use all my developer muscles to be operations person.
However, when you&amp;rsquo;re on-call, you no longer own your uptime.</description>

      <description>I gave a short (~10) minute talk on preparing to move to microservices at the Python meetup in San Francisco.
The main points:
 We all start out with a monolith The monolith never fully goes away That&amp;rsquo;s fine Scope out a new project to make your first microservice Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice  </description>

      <description>This is a recycled post from my tumblr weblog
Ha ha ha just lying the real title should be
Turning a Piece of Shit Chromebook into a Good Enough Development Machine Because You&amp;rsquo;re Unemployed and Feel Like An Ass Trying to Justify Spending $2000 on a God Damned Macbook so You Wound Up Buying a Chromebook Instead Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m unemployed because of reasons and figured there were better things to do with the credit limit on my credit card than spend $2000 on a Macbook, so I bought one of the highest rated Chromebooks at my &amp;ldquo;willing to pay this much&amp;rdquo; price point: the Chromebook C100P.</description>

      <description>This is a recycled post from my tumblr weblog. I&amp;rsquo;ve since had three other jobs, but a lot of what I like still rings true 5 years later in 2020.
Please note I am contractually prohibited from saying what I don&amp;rsquo;t like about most of my prior employers so don&amp;rsquo;t expect any negative posts.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from developer at a large software corporation in the suburbs of Southern California to being a developer at a startup in SoMa in San Francisco.</description>

      <title>Stupid simple API reference for bottle.py web services</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonscheirer.com/weblog/bottle-introspection/</link>

      <description>I have a stupid json-only REST API I implemented in bottle.py. This introspects the default app, gives a dumb readout that should act as an adequate reference for discovery:
@bottle.route(&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;) def index(): bottle.response.content_type = &amp;#39;text/plain&amp;#39; return (&amp;#34;=== API REFERENCE ===\n&amp;#34; + &amp;#34;\n&amp;#34;.join(x[&amp;#39;rule&amp;#39;] for x in bottle.app().routes)) </description>

      <description>For as much shit as I like to talk about C++, I sure can get a lot done quite efficiently in it.
I read an interview with Bjarne a while back and he said C++’s most important feature was destructors. After thinking about it, yeah, they are pretty awesome and I’ve been using the with statement for the same tightly scoped data lifetime in Python.</description>
