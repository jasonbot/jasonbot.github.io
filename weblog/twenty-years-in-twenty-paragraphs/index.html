				<p><strong>2001</strong>: High school. Getting into college wasa full time job. Standardized tests. Had a job at the County of Riverside writing webapps. Accepted a no-application-needed scholarship to UC Riverside in Computer Science. 9/11 happened the week before classes started.</p>
<p><strong>2002</strong>: Mad at the lack of attention I was getting from my CS advisors, and the fact that I was setting the curve in my courses, changed majros to Linguistics. Figured I could switch back if needed.</p>
<p><strong>2003</strong>: Dove into linguistics fully. Loved it. Preemptively laid off from my county job due to a pending class action lawsuit where people hired through my position were never given benefits on union membership. Made dean&rsquo;s list handily the quarters that all I had to focus on was school and not employment. Got a job on campus writing webapps for the administration.</p>
<p><strong>2004</strong>: Started on a teaching certificate, moved from UCR student housing to a house a few miles away. Every waking moment was accounted for and it was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>2005</strong>: Graduated, my part-time dev job turned into &ldquo;professional&rdquo; dev jobs where a third of my paycheck went to my benefits. Lots of free time spent tinkering with Linux and random hardware.</p>
<p><strong>2006</strong>: Got first full-time job doing &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;library science&rdquo;. Got used to being out of scool while still working at school.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong>: Got a little scared that the PI of the project disengaged and our funding would eventually run out. Got a big boy job at a startup in Orange County doing server-side coding in Python, worked on a death march project and loved every minute of it.</p>
<p><strong>2008</strong>: Burnt out <em>hard</em> and got a job at Esri, closer to home, and slower paced. World economy imploded, life was pure fear.</p>
<p><strong>2009</strong>: Long-term girlfriend moved out. Threw myself into work.</p>
<p><strong>2010</strong>: Also took on biking and homebrew, spent lots of time with friends. Worked a lot and started throwing myself into putting way too much enthusiasm and expectations into a junior dev position.</p>
<p><strong>2011</strong>: More talks, more dev, more time just goofing off with friends. Ended up with a year&rsquo;ssalary in savings because I never <em>did</em> anything.</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong>: Got tired of Esri, got a job working remote. Hated everything about it. Moved into a sutdio apartment, saved more m,money, life shrunk into a 5 square block circle.</p>
<p><strong>2013</strong>: Snapped out of it and quit the consultancy, went back to Esri. Proposed. Moved in.</p>
<p><strong>2014</strong>: Got a dog. Got married. 2 weeks later, quit my job and interviewed in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>2015</strong>: Moved to the Bay. Worked at a startup. Loved it.</p>
<p><strong>2016</strong>: Moved to a smaller startup. It crashed and burned.</p>
<p><strong>2017</strong>: Worked for Nerdwallet. Big company full of smart people. Wrote cool tools.</p>
<p><strong>2018</strong>: Had a kid. Kept trying to keep my head above water by writing code. The friends I made in SF started moving away.</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong>: Moved to South San Francisco to make room for growing baby. Left Nerdwallet.</p>
<p><strong>2020</strong>: Started at Easypost. World collapsed. Kept it together. Bought a house. Lost 10 years of accrued weight. Got real introspective. Felt like a part of a team in a way I hadn&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p><strong>2021</strong>: Got real good at balancing short-term emergencies and crazy expenses. Kept it together.</p>
