				<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying standalong MP3 players! The <a href="https://www.innioasis.com/products/y1">Innioasis Y1</a> kept coming across my radar, I like the the form factor, it was $50.</p>
<p>What the heck, why not.</p>
<h1 id="and-then">And Then</h1>
<p>The community for this thing is <em>insane</em>, it&rsquo;s just as active as the people doing weird things with <a href="/weblog/rg35xx/">my RG35XX</a>. It&rsquo;s really cool seeing so many people doing neat things with such a simple piece of hardware. And like the RG35XX, part of the value proposition is this is a cheap peice of commodity hardware that would not have been possible in this way even 5 years ago, but is now inexpensive enough and flexible enough to be an incredible product for the money.</p>
<h1 id="rockbox">Rockbox</h1>
<p>I saw you could put <a href="https://github.com/rockbox-y1/rockbox">a flavor of Rockbox on the thing</a> so I did that. The UI out of the box isn&rsquo;t nearly as polished but <a href="https://github.com/y1-community/Innioasis-Updater">there&rsquo;s a neat community-supported updater</a> that goes so far as to install skins for you. I&rsquo;m currently using <a href="https://codeberg.org/joelchrono/AdwaitaPod-Arcticons-rockbox-360p">another Adwaita adaptation I found on the y1 subreddit</a> which handles CJK correctly, which turns out to be important to me.</p>
<p>Rockbox has the ability to create a play log file, so <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/jasonbot">I can scrobble my commute/work listening again</a>!</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/LastFMLog">LastFMLog plugin</a> to manually create a <code>.scrobbler.log</code> file, then use <a href="https://github.com/jeselnik/rb-scrobbler">rb-scrobbler</a> to upload it. It&rsquo;s a manual process I only do every week or so, but it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Three surprises. Not quite complaint territory but worth knowing about:</p>
<ul>
<li>No external storage. My Shanlings had a TF card slot so I could expand and swap the storage easily. This is internal. 128GB so it won&rsquo;t hold my whole library but it holds everything I care about.</li>
<li>No touchscreen. Again, coming from Shanling this took a little bit of getting used to. Pure iPod classic ergonomics, buttons only.</li>
<li>Build quality is not super solid. The screen is plastic, not glass, and it scratched almost immediately. You can definitely &ldquo;feel&rdquo; a center of gravity while the majority of the device fgeels light. No metal in its construction. It doesn&rsquo;t feel brittle but by no means is it a luxury experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>This thing is a lot of fun to use, though! The novelty will eventually wear off but it feels good to have something iPod shaped in my life again.</p>
