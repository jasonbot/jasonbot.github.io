				<p>Wanting a small, pocketable handheld for bus rides, etc., I saw the <a href="https://www.keepretro.com/products/miyoo-mini">Miyoo Mini</a> and attempted to purchase one. They are <em>incredibly</em> hard to acquire.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx">Anbernic RG35XX</a> presented itself as an alternative, and it was actually possible to buy one.</p>
<p>I got one for about $60 on Amazon and was immediately in love. It had a decent built in game library, decent battery life, and was the perfect size. Not too big, not to small. Fits in a pants pocket or a little random orner of a carrying bag no problem.</p>
<p>The stock SD card and OS is servicable, but I replaced it with my own SD card with my own legally acquired ROM library. I use <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/garlicos-for-76561333">GarlicOS</a> and I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. At one point <a href="https://github.com/jasonbot/platinum-garlic">I even made a skin for it</a>. I normally play Neo-Geo, PSX, and GBA games. The best part about emulation is that all those quarter munchers become way more playable when you just have to hit select to insert a quarter. On an average Metal Slug run (any sequel) it would have cost me close to $20 based on how many times I get game overs.</p>
<p>I like it so much that I bought my 5 year old one and put <a href="https://github.com/shauninman/union-minui">MinUI</a> on it. Aside from being largely text-based which isn&rsquo;t great for a 5 year old, it&rsquo;s super usable and its no-frills approach makes it ideal for people who just want to play games.</p>
<p>My only concern is that the only firmware that runs Dreamcast is <a href="https://rg35xx-cfw.github.io/">Batocera</a>, which I am not particularly inclined to use as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Honestly, I play this more than my Steam Deck. I take it with me all the time since it&rsquo;s so small. Waiting rooms, the bus, it&rsquo;s a great little thing to pull out when you have a few seconds to spare.</p>
