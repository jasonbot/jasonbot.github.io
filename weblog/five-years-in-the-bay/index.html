				<p>February 8th marks the fifth anniversary of me moving to the Bay Area to work for tech startups. In retrospect it&rsquo;s been a great experience despite it being the Bay Area.</p>
<h1 id="culture">Culture</h1>
<p>Living in the Inland Empire, I was an hour away from LA and all that culture, but I never bothered doing it. Living 5 miles outside of San Francisco has mean the City is a constant part of my life: restaurants, concerts, museums, lots of things I could have <em>theoretically</em> done more of in SoCal but never bothered to.</p>
<h1 id="professional-development">Professional Development</h1>
<p>While the Bay Area is a terrible echo chamber full of tech magpies who cling onto the newest shiny thing, it&rsquo;s also been good to be on that cutting edge and see it for what it is: it&rsquo;s not a holy priesthood of people Up There going to meetups you have to <em>hope</em> get recorded and put online a month later, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to get back into web development after years of being out of it and the landscape has changed a lot but all the fundamentals are the same. The <code>Referer</code> HTTP header still exists.</p>
<h1 id="quality-of-life">Quality of Life</h1>
<p>Quality of life is a mixed bag. It&rsquo;s crowded and expensive, but there&rsquo;s stuff to do. We basically throw an entire paycheck into our apartment and single car, but I can take public transit everywhere and we&rsquo;re an hour away from Napa. Now that we&rsquo;re parents we appreciate the suburban wasteland that is the Inland Empire as a good place for kids.</p>
