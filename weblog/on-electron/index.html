				<p>Having spent the last 6 months working on <a href="https://www.notion.com/desktop">an Electron app full-time</a>, my Stockholm Syndrome has kicked in and I&rsquo;ve come around to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to disparagingly refer to an Electron app as bloated, or a crappy wrapper around a web app. This is lazy, reductive thinking that travels well in short-form media like TikTok and Elon Musk&rsquo;s <em>𝕏: The Everything App</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say this in so many words over and over: do you hate Electron out of</p>
<ol>
<li>Groupthink,</li>
<li>Out of misguided and impractical engineering aesthetics, or</li>
<li>Because you would prefer the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; apps you see written in it to not exist at all, over existing but being &lsquo;bad&rsquo; to you?</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>That is, is the framework that allows bad apps to proliferate <em>bad on its own</em> for enabling bad programmers or <em>good</em> for enabling <em>skilled and unskilled programmers alike</em> to participate in software engineering? Or <em>both</em>?</p>
<p>Oh my oh my do I love being ambivalent on everything and I want to pass that along to you.</p>
<h1 id="electron-isnt-just-a-browser-wrapper">Electron Isn&rsquo;t Just A Browser Wrapper</h1>
<p>Aside from wrapping a web page, though, is <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app">a whole truckload of stuff</a> to make a carefully and comprehensively written Electron app <em>actually good</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window creation and management</li>
<li>Menus, you know, like system menus</li>
<li>Custom tray icons</li>
<li>Dock icon overlays</li>
<li>Apple Touchbar customizations (RIP)</li>
<li>Opting to run the app on startup</li>
<li>Sending crash reports to interested parties</li>
<li>Writing additional native code in native languages like C++ and Rust via Node extensions <em>that give better platform-specific runtime characteristics</em>.
<ul>
<li>I can use the native filesystem.</li>
<li>I can use native builds of machine learning libraries versus hoping you&rsquo;re patient enough to watch them run slower and worse in Webassembly.</li>
<li>All of a sudden things that ran slow on your computer or non-privately on some SaaS company&rsquo;s server are happening quickly and efficiently <em>on your hardware</em> on <em>your desk</em> with <em>no network round-trips</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And more! And after all this, it happens to let you place rectangles in those windows that are views into the Chromium rendering engine.</p>
<p>If an Electron app you&rsquo;re using doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> mostly native, it&rsquo;s more an indictment of the nature of the people making the app than the framework they&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>The whole point of Electron is to provide a decent, native desktop experience and uses HTML/CSS/Javascript as its core language for user interface and the Nodejs runtime and its ecosystem behind the curtain. Familiar tools, fast development. In some cases, this development is only <em>feasible</em> via Electron: when you can reuse half your codebase you&rsquo;re halfway there!</p>
<h2 id="the-operating-system-webview-is-a-lie-and-a-nightmare-and-probably-worse-than-nothing">The Operating System Webview is a Lie and a Nightmare and Probably Worse than Nothing</h2>
<p>The words in the subheading immediately above about cover it. I was using another webview-based framework (who cares which) for <a href="https://codeberg.org/jasonbot/ollama-desktop-with-wails">an app</a> and I had a pretty cool UX with sidebar tabs that rendered vertically to save space via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/text-orientation">text orientation</a>. The webviews in 50% of the platforms I tested didn&rsquo;t do this, they rendered the text horizontally, breaking my UI. Flexbox wasn&rsquo;t fully there. Some of the platforms (Linux) didn&rsquo;t even support changing fonts <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>I now had another variable I had close to zero control over regarding my rendering engine. I now had web technologies, inconsistently applied, that I had to <em>extensively</em> test on every platform. I could not trust my UI to be a UI.</p>
<p>Packaging a rendering engine gives me guarantees of rendering capabilities independent of the operating system&rsquo;s webview. I can&rsquo;t tell a paying customer &ldquo;sorry man that&rsquo;s just the way it is on Windows 10&rdquo; with a straight face.</p>
<h1 id="bloat-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder">Bloat is in the Eye of the Beholder</h1>
<h2 id="if-youre-distributing-containerized-apps-or-static-binaries-youre-just-as-guilty-of-the-same-original-sin">If You&rsquo;re Distributing Containerized Apps or Static Binaries You&rsquo;re Just As Guilty of the Same Original Sin</h2>
<p>We already have <code>libc</code> back at home. An Electron installation brings a lot of its own libraries along. This is a conscious choice. An Electron app comes batteries included. You can afford 250 megs of HD space for an app you use daily, you disk cheapskate.</p>
<p>Electron bundles all that inside itself. It&rsquo;s the equivalent to a static binary that doesn&rsquo;t use the system <code>libc</code>. It&rsquo;s the equivalent to a full-blown, dozen-gigabyte Ubuntu system used as an image base just to host a single web app process in a container. You accept batteries included software elsewhere: don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite and complain in this case.</p>
<h2 id="are-you-sure-youre-reading-the-task-manager-correctly">Are You Sure You&rsquo;re Reading the Task Manager Correctly?</h2>
<p>The RAM column on the task manager is showing how much memory the Electron process has asked the Operating System to put aside for it. Keep in mind, in any operating system released since the 1990s this <em>does not mean there is dedicated hardware RAM allocated to it</em>. The process may have pre-allocated a gig because it anticipates needing it but hasn&rsquo;t yet, and that &ldquo;memory&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t all in RAM anyway: it swaps out into page files on disk when unused! The OS could be managing 4GB for the process but only a few hundred megs of that is being actively accessed in hardware short-term Random Access Memory, the rest being paged out to disk. Operating systems are also clever enough to say &ldquo;you asked for a 2 gig page but haven&rsquo;t touched it yet, so I&rsquo;m not going to allocate it until you do. I just know you have dibs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this regard Electron is being upfront about how much storage it&rsquo;s using and that storage is ephemeral: the task manager app doesn&rsquo;t tell you how much disk space an app has permanently written to disk. It <em>does</em> tell you how much RAM the app is &lsquo;borrowing&rsquo; and will return when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<h2 id="more-processes--more-bad-is-just-a-silly-take">&ldquo;More processes&rdquo; = &ldquo;More Bad&rdquo; is Just a Silly Take</h2>
<p>You may also be angry that Electron has more than one line in Task Manager. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an Electron Worker Process?&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Why does it need so many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, weird take and I think it&rsquo;s just surface-level &ldquo;too many lines on the UI&rdquo; type knee-jerk reaction. Processes are for safety! Two blocks of code are isolated from each other as separate processes so if one goes down the other does not. Electron has this because Chromium has this because some web developers are maniacs and write code that take down the entire browser, so now the blast radius is limited to a single browser tab.</p>
<p>Modern operating systems, again, are excellent at handling large numbers of processes. It&rsquo;s a perfectly valid bit of software engineering to have child processes. Processes are not your enemy.</p>
<h1 id="its-a-way-safer-bet-to-just-use-html-for-ui">It&rsquo;s a Way Safer Bet to Just Use HTML for UI</h1>
<h2 id="longevity">Longevity</h2>
<p>HTML and Javascript have a long, unbroken 30+ year lineage in which improvements have been additive: never destructive (except maybe the demise of <code>&lt;marquee/&gt;</code>), and never a full fork (except that now-extinct misadventure into XHTML).</p>
<p>The W3C is run by the most bureaucratic, glacially-paced working groups sponsored by the most hatefully pedantic employees at the largest, most inertia-driven tech companies in the world. This means that toy features that are unlikely to have a long lifespan won&rsquo;t get into the working spec. A bunch of orgs all have to agree to implement the feature in their parallel implementations before the feature&rsquo;s really considered usable. None of us is as obstructive as all of us.</p>
<p>The only extant UI frameworks I am aware of with the same relative longevity are X11 and Win32, and neither of them have been capable of the degree and pace of modernization that HTML/CSS/JS have had. (I will include QT in a respectable but distant third place here after Win32 and X).</p>
<p>I can tell you that picking whatever &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; XAML horror Microsoft is currently pushing is a bad idea! You&rsquo;re going to need specialists who are hard to find to work on it when it is discontinued for the Next XAML Horror.</p>
<h2 id="portability">Portability</h2>
<p>This goes without saying: Chromium runs on every major platform. Most browser engines outside of Chromium are also multiplatform (Firefox, Servo, Ladybird). The part that draws the pixels on the screen draws the pixels the same everywhere. It covers the whole &ldquo;exposing OS native components in a cross platform way,&rdquo; up to and including accessibility mechanisms built on OS-level buttons and text. It&rsquo;s a good way of describing user experience in code that works pretty well on every modern device.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-only-realistic-way-you-clowns-are-getting-anything-nice-on-linux">This is the Only Realistic Way you Clowns are Getting Anything Nice on Linux</h2>
<p>As a volunteer open source enthusiast, I can see myself pouring hours of love and care into a Linux-only app that faithfully and elegantly follows the Gnome HIG. I cannot see myself doing this for a paycheck. I am willing to endure that pain for the sake of my art, but not for the sake of closing out issues for customers.</p>
<p>Easy ports from Win/Mac to Linux are the most likely way you&rsquo;re going to see your app on Linux, and Electron is probability-wise the most likely way to get there. I can&rsquo;t justify putting more than 1% of my work hours on builds that only reach 1% of our user base. I just can&rsquo;t do that at work. If I can get 75% overlap for Linux by parasitizing my Windows and Mac dev time via Electron, you&rsquo;re more likely to get a Linux app. If it&rsquo;s just another build target with a very small amount, hopefully 1% total, on platform specific issues, you have a chance of seeing it on Linux.</p>
<h2 id="hiring">Hiring</h2>
<p>Large organizations are risk averse. This means they want interchangeable resources to avoid bottlenecks. Humans are resources, just ask your Human Resources department. Being able to pull from the largest possible pool of frontend engineers with no training required is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an inconsiderate move to trap your engineers in dead-end technologies. If a replaceable frontend engineer has 5 years of fully non-transferable experience on your proprietary frontend, when <em>you</em> throw them away due to <em>your</em> idiot budget decisions <em>they</em> have to write off 5 years of their lives on their resumes. That framework isn&rsquo;t applicable elsewhere. Boo on you, you monsters. Using an industry standard, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; framework is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for employee and organization both.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Electron is a low risk way for large organizations to add desktop features to something that originated on the web (probably a Node/React boilerplate app that grew past its original purposes, let&rsquo;s not lie). You need to ask yourself the question when you see a bad Electron app: is this better than nothing? Didn&rsquo;t Electron simply allow the app developers to unleash a usability nightmare on you? Didn&rsquo;t it enable them to provide a nice, uniform, <em>native-enough feeling</em> application that might be bulky and aesthetically unpleasing from a software engineering perspective but is in practice a workable experience?</p>
