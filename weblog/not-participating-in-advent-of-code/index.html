				<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted. I&rsquo;ve been guilted/peer pressured into participating in the AoC for at least 5 years. I&rsquo;m tired, I&rsquo;m defeated, I&rsquo;m unable to meet its weird expectations consistently and still I remain a competent software engineer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not participating in his year&rsquo;s Advent of Code. Every year I try and get stymied by day 14 of so because of practical considerations.</p>
<h1 id="it-emphasizes-fast-solutions-over-good-ones">It Emphasizes Fast Solutions Over Good Ones</h1>
<p>The entire gamification of the problems is about solving them as quickly as possible. Not about maintainable solutions, not rewarding cleverness, the scoreboard is entirely fueled by finishing quickly.</p>
<p>A professional software engineer does not hammer out code as quickly as possible. There are optimization and organizational and maintainability issues to consider. This only fuels the worst parts of the junior programmer ego.</p>
<h1 id="its-not-realistic">It&rsquo;s Not Realistic</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write parser/combinators in my day-to-day. While they may be fun, most of my day is reading standard library documentation and wrestling with Tailwind.</p>
<p>These problems <em>can be</em> fun in small doses, but it flexes muscles I do not use regularly and I can work out when I do need them.</p>
<h1 id="its-pointless">It&rsquo;s Pointless</h1>
<p>The only people you have to celebrate with are other AoC participants. And come next December, your accomplishments evaporate in favor the the next arbitrary set of problems. I get enough of this at work.</p>
<h1 id="doing-work-outside-of-work-is-fucking-stupid">Doing Work Outside of Work is Fucking Stupid</h1>
<p>The problem sets represent things that aren&rsquo;t practical at work and don&rsquo;t apply to anything you might do at home for fun. This is a chore. I don&rsquo;t know why I have chosen to inflict unneccessary chores upon myself in the past, but in general I don&rsquo;t think a rational person is going to do extra work for the sake of work. That&rsquo;s just self punishment.</p>
<h1 id="it-represents-a-dark-third-place">It Represents a Dark &ldquo;Third Place&rdquo;</h1>
<p>In general, a &ldquo;third place&rdquo; is a place outside of work and home like a coffee shop where one might recharge and socialize. Advent of Code is the same thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a work project, it&rsquo;s not a personal project, it&rsquo;s some third thing.</p>
<p>In this way it&rsquo;s not constructive: it&rsquo;s hard to justify doing &rsquo;empty&rsquo; coding where you&rsquo;re not advancing a side project or your employer&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<h1 id="its-timing-is-in-the-worst-part-of-the-year">Its Timing is in the Worst Part of the Year</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m flying in December. I&rsquo;m driving. I&rsquo;m spending time going to my kid&rsquo;s Christmas concerts. I&rsquo;m not around at 9:00 PM every night to rush through a problem and it consistently gives me anxiety when I try to participate.</p>
