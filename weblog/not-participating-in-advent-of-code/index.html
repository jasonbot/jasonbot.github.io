				<p>I&rsquo;m not participating in his year&rsquo;s Advent of Code.</p>
<h1 id="it-emphasizes-fast-solutions-over-good-ones">It Emphasizes Fast Solutions over Good Ones</h1>
<p>The entire gamification of the problems is about solving them as quickly as possible. Not about maintainable solutions, not rewarding cleverness, the scoreboard is entirely fueled by finishing quickly.</p>
<p>A professional software engineer does not hammer out code as quickly as possible. There are optimization and organizational and maintainability issues to consider.</p>
<h1 id="its-not-realistic">It&rsquo;s not realistic</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write parser/combinators in my day-to-day. While they may be fun, most of my day is reading standard library documentation and wrestling with Tailwind. These problems are fun, but flexing muscles I do not use regularly and can work out when I do need them.</p>
<h1 id="it-represents-a-dark-third-place">It represents a dark &ldquo;Third Place&rdquo;</h1>
<p>In general, a &ldquo;third place&rdquo; is a place outside of work and home like a coffee shop where one might recharge and socialize. Advent of Code is the same thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a work project, it&rsquo;s not a personal project, it&rsquo;s some third thing.</p>
<p>In this way it&rsquo;s not constructive: it&rsquo;s hard to justify doing &rsquo;empty&rsquo; coding where you&rsquo;re nod advancing a side project or your employer&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<h1 id="its-timing-is-in-the-worst-part-of-the-year">Its timing is in the worst part of the year</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m flying in December. I&rsquo;m driving. I&rsquo;m spending time going to my kid&rsquo;s Christmas concerts. I&rsquo;m not around at 9:00 PM every night to rush through a problem and it consistently gives me anxiety when I try to participate.</p>
