				<h1 id="problem-space">Problem Space</h1>
<p>At <a href="https://www.academia.edu/">my new job</a>, my new team engages in a team activity: every other week we get together for 30 minutes to play a game together online. We&rsquo;re mixed hybrid, meaning about half of us work in office and half of us are grandfathered/exceptioned in to working remotely. this means we can&rsquo;t play a board/card game in person, but has to be procurable over the internet in a Zoom call.</p>
<p>It is now my turn to host a game.</p>
<h1 id="picking-a-game">Picking a Game</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone is tired of playing Werewolf and variants at this point. I wanted something easy to pick up in the spirit of the games we&rsquo;ve played on game days since I joined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual</li>
<li>Multiplayer</li>
<li>Browser-based</li>
<li>Very low barrier to entry</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pick Yet Another Card Game. That sounds boring.</p>
<h1 id="minecraft">Minecraft?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ActionRetro">One retro YouTuber I like</a> pretty consistently plays <a href="https://www.classicube.net/">ClassiCube</a> on the hardware devices he features in his videos. This seemed like a pretty good option: lower software requirements then MC Java Edition, as well as not requiring a paid account to play. It even <a href="https://www.classicube.net/server/play/">has a browser-based client</a> that can connect to servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ClassiCube/ClassiCube/blob/master/doc/hosting-flask.md">ClassiCube has documentation on Github for how to run a browser-based session</a>.</p>
<p>This seems pretty easy: you host a web page that has the ClassiCube JS client on it, and then configure it via Javascript in the page&rsquo;s code to connect to your hosted server.</p>
<h2 id="of-course-i-have-to-write-software-to-run-software-it-is-my-wont">Of Course I Have To Write Software to Run Software, It is My Wont</h2>
<p>The end product I made was <a href="https://github.com/jasonbot/cube-with-friends">Cube With Friends on Github</a>. It&rsquo;s a very easy to set up little program that does all the above manual steps &ndash; at build time it embeds all the resources it needs from the internet into a single Go executable, and has other niceness like overlaying a pre-authored config that turns off ClassiCube authentication so people can join without having ClassiCube accounts.</p>
<h1 id="getting-to-it-from-other-computers">Getting to It From Other Computers</h1>
<p>Now that I had something running, how do I get other players on here?</p>
<p>I spun up <code>cube-with-friends</code> on my laptop and started thinking my way through that problem.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-on-the-internet">Hosting on the Internet</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sacrifice one of my Raspberry Pis to be a permanent host for this app, and I&rsquo;m not going to mess with seeing if I can get to the public IP that my ISP assigns me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spin up a new VM on GCP and assign it a Real Internet IP Address and do all the work of exposing a service to the world if I can help it either.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-on-tailnet">Hosting on Tailnet</h2>
<p>Here comes an idea: my employer pays for a Tailscale corporate account, and all of our dev machines belong to the work tailnet. This is good, I can just point everyone to my work Mac.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-want-to-put-a-personal-device-on-the-work-tailnet">I Don&rsquo;t Want to Put a Personal Device on the Work Tailnet</h3>
<p>My Raspberry Pi Collection has begun to dwindle, and I am not a fan of putting personal devices on work networks anyway.</p>
<h3 id="my-work-mac-has-a-firewall-i-cant-disable">My Work Mac Has a Firewall I Can&rsquo;t Disable</h3>
<p>As is corporate policy, all of our work laptops have a firewall we can&rsquo;t turn off. I can run Cube with Friends locally but the TCP ports are blocked.</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-want-to-ask-the-infra-team-how-to-host-a-minecraft-server-thats-embarrassing">I Don&rsquo;t Want to ask the Infra Team How to Host a Minecraft Server, That&rsquo;s Embarrassing</h3>
<p>I could host a machine on the Tailnet on our corporate Infrastructure, but I&rsquo;m not on the infra team and I don&rsquo;t know how to do that. I also don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get buy-in for that. I&rsquo;ll save my goodwill for some other day.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-non-firewalled-machine-how-about-linux">Running a Non-Firewalled Machine: How About Linux?</h2>
<h3 id="rub-some-docker-on-it">Rub Some Docker on It</h3>
<p>I quickly threw together a preliminary Dockerfile to make an image of a cube-with-friends instance, and started making progress. Now how to get it on the Tailnet?</p>
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1453/quick-guide-docker">This guide to using docker-compose to make a container join a Tailnet</a> made me very sad at the complexity involved, but hopeful. I could run a Docker container on Linux, have the container join the Tailnet, and it would not be subject to the macOS firewall on the hardware network interfaces.</p>
<p>I switched from Docker Desktop to <a href="https://github.com/abiosoft/colima">Colima</a> a few years back &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been moving away from using brand named Docker utils for a while now since 1) Docker has a <a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/">weird licensing tripwire</a> I don&rsquo;t want to set off and 2) <a href="https://github.com/containers/">containers are just a commodity</a> in 2024 &ndash; I use Podman on all my Linux machines to do containerization.</p>
<p>Colima just works, and <a href="https://github.com/abiosoft/colima?tab=readme-ov-file#runtimes">has multiple personalities</a> which was useful at my last job for dicking about with k8s and stuff.</p>
<h3 id="colima-is-short-for-containers-on-lima">CoLima is Short for &ldquo;Containers on Lima&rdquo;</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lima-vm/lima">The Lima Project</a> implements the underlying functionality of running a Linux VM on macOS that can then host the containers, since containers require <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/236038/">Linux kernel internals</a> to work (<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/Containers">or not</a>).</p>
<p>Why not short-circuit the process and just use the VM directly? Why bother with another abstraction layer? I&rsquo;ll just use Lima directly and not make myself sad with the extra abstraction layer that a <code>compose</code>-based solution im-&hellip;poses.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-vm">Starting a New VM</h2>
<p>So I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloned the repo <code>git clone git@github.com:jasonbot/cube-with-friends.git</code></li>
<li>Started a new VM using <code>lima create default</code></li>
<li>I edited the configuration so that my auto-mounted home drive was <code>writable: true</code> before launching (this is important if you&rsquo;re keeping the cloned repo on your Mac home dir and not on the VM)</li>
<li>Installed prereqs: <code>sudo apt install golang mono-runtime</code></li>
<li>Ran <code>lima</code> to get into the VM</li>
<li>Edited the <code>/etc/hostname</code> to something memorable</li>
<li>Restarted the VM</li>
<li>Went back in via <code>lima</code> and Installed Tailscale via <code>curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>Signed in to tailscale <code>sudo tailscale up</code></li>
<li>Ran the cube-with-friends server: <code>go run cmd/server.go</code></li>
<li>Opened a browser to <code>http://my-new-machine:5555/</code> and verified it worked</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So there we go! Something a little more interesting than playing another card game.</p>
