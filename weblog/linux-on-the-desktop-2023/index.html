				<p>I have a Gaming PC I bought from Costco when my wife told me &ldquo;I should maybe get back into my old hobbies&rdquo; in the summer of 2020. It came with Win10, which is fine and it&rsquo;s probably good to have at least one Windows machine in the house at any given time.</p>
<p>The thing is: Windows is <em>annoying</em>. Every time Windows ran an update I had to run <a href="https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-">a third-party uninstall tool</a> to undo the changes Windows updates made to the graphics drivers, which started hanging and crashing if they weren&rsquo;t the exact specific ones the machine shipped with.</p>
<p>We had a flood in the winter of 2022. Our new home office was under half an inch of water and many of my electronics were unsalvageably water damaged. I placed this gaming machine (which hardly got any usage anyway) outside to dry.</p>
<p>The case then accrued condensation inside, which convinced me this thing was now, if it had not been previously, fully water damaged e-waste.</p>
<p>In April I was bored and wanted to see if I could at least save the hard drives before taking the machine to recycling. On a lark I tried to turn in on and surprise surprise, it booted no problem!</p>
<p>Since I had already written it off as &ldquo;dead,&rdquo; I figured it was fine to put Linux on it. I had read about <a href="https://nobaraproject.org/">Nobara Linux</a> as it was done by the same guy who does a bunch of Proton and SteamOS hacking, and it had a bunch of quality of life improvements to make it gaming friendly: it even had the Steam client installed out of the box. Once I got over my distaste of using a non-.deb based distro I was off to the races.</p>
<p>I like the Gnome desktop. This ships with a newer version of it.</p>
<p>For the whole &ldquo;I need at least one Windows machine in the house&rdquo; thing: Proton plays all my games. Steam on here does 95% of what I need. TYhe only Windows app I <em>really</em> need is <a href="https://www.xara.com/photo-graphic-plus/">Xara</a>, because I&rsquo;ve been using it or its lineage since 1999 and I have muscle memory. Every attempt I&rsquo;ve made in every flavor of Wine has failed, and even <a href="http://www.xaraxtreme.org/">the Linux versions they briefly released</a> are now too bit-rotted to be usable on a modern installation on an x64 machine.</p>
<p>So Wine mostly has me covered, but for that single app I&rsquo;m now using <a href="https://virt-manager.org/">virt-manager</a> to handle a single Win10 install. It it&rsquo;s got a very small footprint and it runs my programs and is <em>probably</em> a better idea than an Win7 or XP VM.</p>
<p>So Nobara has been fine for the past several months. I have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions">VS Code as an RPM source</a>, I just download Go as <code>.tar.gz</code> and plop it into <code>~</code>, Python via <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">PyEnv</a>, and then <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install">google cloud command line apps</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://flathub.org/en">Flatpak</a> has turned out to be this amazing dark horse over the past 3 years to find decent software in a distro-independent fashion. The only annoyance remaining is that there&rsquo;s the occasional double-buffering-flicker thing that pops up on 3d accelerated UI apps.</p>
