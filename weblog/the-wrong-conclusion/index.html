				<p>A common pattern I have come to recognize everywhere as an anti-pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Person starts a dialogue establishing a problem, upon which we all agree</li>
<li>Person continues on down the same line of conversation, outlining a solution</li>
<li>Person comes to a conclusion which is a call to action</li>
</ol>
<p>I see this a lot because step 1 seems to short-circuit the thinking behind the rest of the logic. You got a narrative going that you feel compelled to continue to listen to, and assume it&rsquo;s only going to stay sane.</p>
<p>However, <strong>just because you have identified a problem does not mean your solution is correct</strong>. Stop yourself when a person opens a paragraph and remember that <em>where they are going is not necessarily the only path, or even a sensible one</em>.</p>
<p>The example I see most currently is about AI somehow matching human intelligence, usually in the context of LLMs.</p>
<ol>
<li>LLMs exist, and seem to have novel properties that mimic humans producing language</li>
<li>Therefore, LLMs are the same as humans producing language</li>
<li>Therefore, LLMs have all the other capacities of humans and have been endowed with human nature and will replace us all</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decorated these talking points with some straw men that are usually left implicit when usually presented, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Just because you agree with the problem statement does not mean that the conclusion is correct just because it occurs a few sentences later.</p>
