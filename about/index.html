				<p>I am Jason Scheirer, a completely unremarkable software developer in the Bay Area initially from the Inland Empire. A rough timeline of my life as a software engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start programming BASIC in elementary school, escalating to pirated QuickBasic and Turbo Pascal, as well as legal but squirrely <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a>/<a href="http://www.rhide.com/">RHIDE</a>/<a href="https://liballeg.org/">Allegro</a></li>
<li>Get a part-time job in late high school writing &ldquo;web applications&rdquo;</li>
<li>Get bored in intro CS classes and change majors to Linguistics</li>
<li>Decide that taking a mere full courseload is for suckers who like sleep and good grades and work 30 hrs/wk to pay tuition and take night classes to teach English at the same time</li>
<li>Backpedal and get as much CS coursework done as possible before hitting the unit limit for graduation, managing to squeeze in the minor just in time</li>
<li>List about from company to company in SoCal writing software for 10 years, mostly Python/C, mostly geospatial adjacent</li>
<li>Move to Bay Area and list about from startup to startup writing software, mostly Python</li>
</ul>
<p>A rough timeline of my entire life, including the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Born</li>
<li>Childhood</li>
<li>Early adulthood</li>
<li>Adulthood</li>
<li>Writing bullet points in a text editor</li>
<li><em>(Speculative)</em> Dead</li>
</ul>
<p>The theme for this weblog is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/colorchestra/smol">smol</a>, built in <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> through the magic of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">a CNAME</a>. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> and <a href="https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/">Berkeley Mono</a> (hosted here and not on Google Fonts) so my indulgence of picking custom type shouldn&rsquo;t hurt the load times of the pages as much as it <em>could</em> (or spy on you).</p>
<p>For diagrams and artwork I use <a href="https://monodraw.helftone.com/">Monodraw</a> and an older version of <a href="https://www.xara.com/us/photo-graphic-designer/">Xara Photo and Graphic Designer</a>. Sometimes <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a> and <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> come along for the party, too.</p>
<p>I do not have any sort of analytics on this page. I have no idea what my traffic or &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; stats look like. I could be getting 1 hit a month, I could be getting 100000 hits a day on some single blog post. I honestly have no idea and it&rsquo;s not something I want to think about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no Javascript on this page. I can&rsquo;t justify &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; the &ldquo;experience&rdquo; of viewing words on a screen with some stupid runtime-in-the-browser trickery.</p>
<p>(Late 2022 update: Javascript exists, where necessary, for &ldquo;functional&rdquo; pages like to display games but not for content load or navigation UI trickery.)</p>
<p>If I can ask you but one favor, it is this: if you like the site, tell immediate friends and subscribe to it in your favorite RSS reader. I do not write to provide Internet Brain Geniuses with material to fractally complain about to feel better about themselves on Social Media. I would rather those people not know I exist. Please only share these posts on places where the comments section do not devolve into utter idiocy.</p>
<p>If this site provides you with value, great. If not, keep in mind I owe you nothing.</p>
